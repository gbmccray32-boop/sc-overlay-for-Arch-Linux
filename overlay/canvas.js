/**
 * THE WIDGET CANVAS — the overlay shell that hosts every widget, including the tracker.
 *
 * The WIDGETS registry, per-widget frames and their lifecycle, grouping and group tabs, the
 * bottom chrome bar and its per-widget settings popover, drag/resize/arrange mode, the two
 * independent fade alphas, text scale and tilt, the hub, the what's-new card, the mining scan box,
 * the contract-board box, the payout panel, the Web Page widget's native-view mask, and the OCR
 * status chrome.
 *
 * Everything the TRACKER PANEL itself draws is missions-tracker.js, which loads before this file.
 * The split is by reason to change: this file moves when the widget system does.
 *
 * Lifted verbatim out of missions.html (2026-08-19). Classic scripts on one page share a global
 * lexical environment, so nothing here is exported and not one call site moved; load order is
 * preserved exactly — this runs after the tracker, as it always did.

  // ── The Blueprint panel is a REGISTRY widget now ────────────────────────────────────────
  // Its geometry, drag, resize, grouping and text size all run through the same code as every

  /** DEV RELOAD — reload widget iframes in place so a code change is visible without restarting.
   *
   *  Driven by `POST /api/dev/reload` on the sidecar, which pushes a `{kind:"devreload"}` frame
   *  down the missions SSE that this document already holds open. Dev builds only.
   *
   *  🔴 IT MUST STAY NON-DESTRUCTIVE. The only other `webContents.reload()` in this app lives
   *  inside `resetWidgetLayout()`, which WIPES the arrangement. A reload that could scramble Sub's
   *  layout while showing him a change would be worse than the restart it replaces, so this
   *  touches nothing but the frame's own document: no layout write, no persist, no registry pass.
   *
   *  🔴 RELEASE THE KEYBOARD GRAB FIRST, VIA THE REGISTRY'S OWN `onHide`. A widget in typing mode
   *  holds a grab that makes the WHOLE canvas interactive on every display — reload its frame
   *  without lowering that and the grab is stranded with no page left to lower it, so neither
   *  clicks nor keys reach the game and nothing on screen can recover it. `onHide` is the exact
   *  path hiding a widget already uses (`__<key>ExitTyping`), so this cannot drift from it.
   *
   *  ⚠️ WHAT A RELOAD COSTS, and it is inherent to re-running the page: chat scrollback, an
   *  unsaved Journal note, and any live SSE/poll inside that frame are gone. Reload one widget by
   *  key when you can rather than all of them.
   *
   *  ⚠️ WHAT THIS CANNOT REFRESH: `canvas.js` and `missions.html` themselves (this document), and
   *  anything under `src/` — the sidecar's own code. Those still need an app restart. Only pages
   *  the sidecar serves per-request are picked up here. */

  // ── Per-widget fade: the PANEL and its TEXT, independently ───────────────────────────────
  // Sub's ask (2026-08-11): a widget you can almost see through, still carrying text you can
  // read. `w.s.dim` is the PANEL alpha and `w.s.dimText` the TEXT alpha — each 0.2–1, or null
  // meaning "inherit". Null is the default, so a user who never opens these controls keeps
  // exactly the behaviour they had; and dimText falls back to the PANEL value before the global
  // one, so moving only the panel slider still behaves like the single control it replaces.
  //
  // 🔑 BOTH ALPHAS ARE PUSHED INTO THE WIDGET'S OWN DOCUMENT, never applied to the wrapper.
  // CSS does not cascade across an iframe boundary, but every widget page is served by our own
  // sidecar, so the frames are same-origin and their documents are writable — the same route
  // applyTextScale() already takes for `zoom`. The wrapper must stay fully opaque: an opacity
  // there would MULTIPLY with the two inside, and multiplication is exactly what made the
  // useful combination unreachable before. Nesting can only ever make text DIMMER than the
  // panel under it, so "faint panel, readable text" does not exist in that model at any
  // setting. Two sibling alphas with no container opacity is the whole trick.
  //
  // 🔑 Which is also why hover stops being a CSS rule. `.widget:hover { opacity: 1 }` cannot
  // reach the document doing the fading, so hover has to be pushed too — and once it is pushed
  // it can be a per-widget preference (`w.s.hoverFull`, default on) rather than a blanket rule.

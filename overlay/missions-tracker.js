/**
 * MISSION & BP TRACKER — everything the tracker panel itself draws.
 *
 * The blueprint pool and its tiles, the mission info and faction drawers, the pill row
 * (`PILL_ORDER`), the community facts, mission search, the completion report card, the manual
 * picker, and the "verify from logs" control. This is the WIDGET. The canvas that hosts it — and
 * hosts every other widget — is canvas.js.
 *
 * The split is by REASON TO CHANGE: this file moves when the mission data or its presentation
 * moves; canvas.js moves when the widget system does.
 *
 * ⚠️ Several functions here are part of the widget suite's public surface — it calls
 * `missionInfoHtml`, `gameFactPills`, `communityPills`, `factChips` and friends directly. Nothing
 * in the source says so. Grep tools/widget-dom-test.cjs before changing what one of them RETURNS.
 *
 * Lifted verbatim out of missions.html (2026-08-19). Classic scripts on one page share a global
 * lexical environment, so nothing here is exported and not one call site moved; load order is
 * preserved exactly.

  // to it, which is the same feedback loop the observer note below is about.

  // arrives with its title intact.
  //
  // 🔑 THE TEXT LIVES IN ONE PLACE (`data-tip`) AND IS COPIED IN ONLY WHILE SHOWN. Rendering it
  // into the popover up front put the whole explanation inside the pill's `textContent` — and

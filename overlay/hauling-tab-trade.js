/**
 * HAULING - THE COMMODITIES TAB: buy low somewhere, haul it, sell high somewhere else.
 *
 * Phase 2. Contracts/Route/Stow are about work the GAME gave you; this one is about cargo you
 * choose to buy with your own money. Nothing here comes from the log - it is the one tab that
 * works with the game closed.
 *
 * ⚠️ RENAMED "Planner" -> "Commodities" 2026-08-23 (Sub), when the two modes were merged into one
 * flat tab row. The id `tabTrade`, the `trade` view name and every `trade`/`td` prefix in here are
 * what the code and the widget suite address, so they stay - only the LABEL moved. Same rule the
 * Log -> Ledger rename followed.
 *
 * 🔴 IT IS ONE OF TWO SOURCES, NOT A DESTINATION. It used to be a tab BECAUSE it was not part of
 * Route; that stopped being true when Route became cargo-agnostic. What is picked here is meant to
 * end up sequenced in Route alongside the contracts - opportunistically, filling the hold the
 * contracts leave empty. Route never ranks the two against each other: contracts rank among
 * themselves in their tab, commodities among themselves in this one.
 *
 * Same file conventions as its siblings: a classic script sharing one lexical scope with
 * hauling.html, so every name here is prefixed `trade`/`td` and nothing is exported.
 *
 * 🔴 THE STANDING CONSTRAINT, AND THE REASON HALF THIS FILE EXISTS: prices are per-terminal and
 * they move. There is no such thing as "the price of Titanium". So every route row carries its own
 * age, which is the OLDER of its two quotes; and where stock is unreported the profit is a
 * CEILING, marked with a `≤`, never a bare number.
 *
 * -- Rebuilt 2026-08-19 after Sub reviewed the first cut ------------------------------------
 *
 * Four of his seven notes were real bugs, not taste, and they are worth recording because three
 * of them were invisible to every test that passed:
 *
 * 1. 🔴 **The run showed what it COST and never what it SOLD FOR.** "I don't know where it really
 *    says how much you're going to get when you sell it." Correct - the row carried a buy-side
 *    capital figure and a margin, so the sell price could only be recovered by arithmetic. The
 *    money line now states `BUY x → SELL y` outright. This is the most important fix here.
 * 2. 🔴 **The big number was unlabelled.** "Is that profit? Because that's not clear." It is, and
 *    it now says so underneath. A number with no noun is a number nobody can act on.
 * 3. 🔴 **The stock toggle changed its LABEL between states**, so "Any stock" could equally have
 *    been the current state or the button's effect - genuinely unreadable. The label is now fixed
 *    ("Confirmed stock") and only the lit state changes. A toggle must never rename itself.
 * 4. 🔴 **The commodity input sat inside `.psug`**, an absolutely-positioned dropdown container,
 *    so it rendered below the panel and had to be scrolled to. It is an ordinary in-flow field.
 *
 * And the one that changes what the tab is FOR:
 *
 * 🔑 **A SYSTEM FILTER IS NOT A NICETY.** Sub: "Fallow Field, where I can buy Bexalite, is in
 * Pyro. But I'm in Stanton." A ranked list whose top rows are in another system is not a
 * recommendation, it is a trap - the travel cost is real and the tiered model already charges 25
 * minutes for the jump. The filter defaults to the system the log says you are in, and falls back
 * to showing everything when the log has not said, because guessing wrong would silently hide the
 * routes you can actually fly.

     one-commodity lookup — and the lookup was the Market tab, which Sub retired when the tabs were
     merged (the Verse Finder already answers "where can I buy X", and the Runs list answers "what
     is worth carrying"). With one view left there is nothing to choose, so `tradeLookup`,
     `tradeNames` and `tradeQuery` went with it.
     🔑 Backhaul was never a mode — it is a FILTER on routes, the same question with the
     destination pinned — so it is unaffected. */
  /* ── THE FUNNEL: what -> buy at -> sell at (2026-08-25) ─────────────────────────────────────
     Sub picked this out of three mockups. His own words for what it is:

       "we'll let them search for the buy-in location. And we'll let them search for the drop-off
        location once they pick the pickup location."

     🔑 THREE SLOTS, AND AN UNSET SLOT IS A FILTER THAT IS NOT APPLIED. With all three empty this
     tab is byte-for-byte the leaderboard it has always been, so nobody has had anything taken away
     — the board has been given a steering wheel. Each filled slot narrows the SAME list; there is
     never a second view and never a mode.

     🔴 EVERY SLOT VALUE COMES FROM DATA, NEVER FROM TYPING. `what` is picked off
     /api/trade/names, and the terminals are picked off `buyAt`/`sellAt` — so a place the commodity
     cannot be bought at is UNREACHABLE rather than merely discouraged. That is the same property
     the Route tab's picker needs, which is why they share one source.

     🔑 THE BODY IS ALWAYS /api/trade/routes. The slots only add query params. There is exactly one
     solver and the widget does no arithmetic of its own — the alternative was a second code path
     producing rows, which is the mistake this file's header already warns about.

     ⛔ `tradeSystem` and `tradeToBody` ARE GONE and must not come back as separate state. They were
     "where a run starts" and "where it ends" living in two variables with two controls; they are
     `tdBuyAt` and `tdSellAt` now, and Backhaul writes into the second one rather than owning a
     third. Two writers on one filter is how a control and the thing it controls drift apart. */

       🔴 THIS SECTION SAID TWO CONTRADICTORY THINGS AT ONCE. The heading was "Still aboard" and a
       row under it could read "on the elevator" — which means the exact opposite, i.e. NOT aboard.
       Sub, looking at his own board: *"the stuff that I turned in, it says on the elevator. I don't
       even know what that's supposed to mean."*

       Two separate faults, and only one of them was the wording:

       1. 🔑 `autoLoaded` IS A FACT ABOUT THE MOMENT OF PURCHASE, NOT A LOCATION. It is the
          `autoLoading[0|1]` flag off the buy line: where the game put the cargo when you paid for
          it. Nothing in the log ever updates it, so rendering it in the present tense is a claim
          the app cannot keep true for one minute past the sale, let alone the three days Sub's lot
          had been sitting there. Past tense, and the age beside it, is the whole repair — the
          information is still useful ("that one is a walk"), it just stops being asserted as now.
       2. The lot Sub was reading really was a leftover, and the journal was right about it: he
          bought 2 SCU of Processed Food on 2026-08-19, one auto-loaded and one to the elevator,
          and sold 1. FIFO closed the auto-loaded lot and left the elevator one. Verified against
          the corpus: there has been no commodity buy or sell in ANY log since 18:49 that day, so
          nothing is missing from the record. It reads wrong because it is worded wrong.

       ⚠️ The heading no longer says where anything is, because the journal does not know. */

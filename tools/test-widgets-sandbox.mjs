/**
 * RUN THE WIDGET SUITE AGAINST A SANDBOXED SIDECAR THAT CARRIES ITS OWN PRICE DATA.
 *
 *   npm run test:widgets:sandbox
 *   npm run test:widgets:sandbox -- --port 8791 --reset --keep
 *   npm run test:widgets:sandbox -- --serve        seed and hold the sidecar, run no suite
 *   npm run test:widgets:sandbox -- --only blueprint          the one-widget loop, sandboxed
 *   npm run test:widgets:sandbox -- --port 8791 -- --only blueprint    same, `--` forwards anything
 *
 * Suite arguments reach `widget-dom-test.cjs` — see the argument split below. An argument this
 * script cannot place is REFUSED, never dropped.
 *
 * `--serve` is what you want while iterating on a widget or running a negative control: it gives
 * you a seeded sidecar to point `OVERLAY_PORT=<n> npm run test:widgets` at, or a probe file, or a
 * browser. A control on anything under `src/` needs the sidecar RESTARTED to be seen at all - tsx
 * does not reload - so re-run this after every such edit.
 *
 * 🔴 WHY THIS EXISTS: FIVE VERSE FINDER ASSERTIONS USED TO PASS OR FAIL ON WHOSE PROFILE THE
 * SIDECAR HAPPENED TO BE POINTED AT.
 *
 * The commodity block of `verse finder: ships, commodities, and which kind of blank` searches for
 * "laranite" and asserts the widget names terminals, states stock in SCU, and points at the Trade
 * widget for selling. Those rows come from `TradePriceStore`, which resolves live -> cache ->
 * bundled:
 *
 *   live     https://subliminal.gg/api/sc/commodity-prices
 *   cache    %APPDATA%/sc-blueprint-tracker/trade-prices.json
 *   bundled  data/commodities.json
 *
 * The bundled snapshot carries NO timestamps, and `verse-commodities.ts` drops any quote with no
 * `asOf` on purpose - an age colour beside a quote whose age is unknowable reads as "fresh". So on
 * the bundled floor every commodity quote is discarded and the Verse Finder answers "laranite"
 * with the same blank it gives a typo. Measured 2026-08-24, that floor is where everybody lands:
 * the live endpoint answers **404** (its item-price sibling answers 200), so only a profile
 * holding a cache written back when it worked - Sub's does - has dated commodity prices at all.
 *
 * A green run therefore meant "somebody's %APPDATA% happens to hold a 657 KB file", which is not
 * a gate. This script removes the question: it seeds a throwaway profile from a committed fixture
 * and runs the suite against a sidecar with no network of its own.
 *
 * -- WHAT IT DOES ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *   1. Owns `.test-profile/` in the repo (gitignored). `--reset` wipes it first.
 *   2. Writes `tools/fixtures/trade-prices.json` into it as a real cache file, stamping each
 *      quote's `asOfDaysAgo` into an absolute `asOf` against the clock it runs on.
 *   3. Starts the sidecar there with SC_NO_SYNC=1 and BOTH price endpoints switched off
 *      (SC_TRADE_URL="" and SC_VERSE_URL=""), so the run touches no network and the item half
 *      reads the committed `data/item-shops.json` rather than whatever the site is serving today.
 *   4. Runs the same three steps `npm run test:widgets` runs, against that port.
 *   5. Kills the sidecar BY THE PID `/api/instance` REPORTS - never by name, never by a
 *      command-line match. That rule exists because a broad filter once took Sub's own app down.
 *
 * 🔑 THE AGES ARE RELATIVE ON PURPOSE. A fixture with absolute timestamps in it starts describing
 * a quote that is one day old and ends up describing one that is three years old, silently moving
 * every row into the oldest age band. Storing the age and stamping it at seed time means the
 * fixture keeps saying what it was written to say for as long as it exists.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE FIXTURE IS NOT SHIPPED. `tools/build-server.mjs` copies `overlay/` and `data/`; nothing
 * under `tools/fixtures/` reaches a build, and the sandbox profile is not the app's profile.
 *
 * -- REGENERATING THE FIXTURE ----------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * It is a trim of a real `trade-prices.json`: every commodity the table knows (122), capped at
 * four quotes each so the name space stays whole while the file stays small, with Laranite kept
 * in full because it is the suite's subject. 473 quotes / 120 KB against the 657 KB it came from.
 * To rebuild it after a patch moves the economy, take a fresh cache file, keep the same fields,
 * and replace each `asOf` with `asOfDaysAgo = (fetchedAt/1000 - asOf) / 86400`.
 *
 * 🔑 KEEP EVERY COMMODITY NAME. Trimming to the handful the assertions mention would make "a
 * commodity is findable from this box" a claim about a table with nothing in it to compete, which
 * is the vacuous version of the same test.

/* ── WHOSE ARGUMENT IS THIS? ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * 🔴 THIS WRAPPER MUST NEVER SWALLOW AN ARGUMENT IT DOES NOT OWN. It used to parse its own flags
 * and drop the rest on the floor, so `--port 8781 --reset -- --only blueprint` ran the FULL 52-suite
 * pass — five and a half minutes — while printing nothing to say `--only` had been discarded. You
 * read "all widget DOM tests passed" and believed you had run a 34-second subset. Both halves are
 * documented workflows (the sandbox is how you iterate without fighting the live app on :8778;
 * `--only` is how you iterate on one widget) and combining them silently gave you neither.
 *
 * The split, and it has no silent branch in it:
 *   · everything after a bare `--` is FORWARDED VERBATIM. That is the escape hatch, and it keeps
 *     working when the suite grows a flag this file has never heard of.
 *   · before that, a flag this wrapper owns is consumed, and a flag the SUITE owns is forwarded,
 *     so the common `--only blueprint` needs no separator.
 *   · anything else is REFUSED — exit 2, print both lists — exactly the way `--only` itself refuses
 *     an unknown widget key. A typo must cost you a message, never a five-minute run of the wrong
 *     thing.

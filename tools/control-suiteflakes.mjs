/**
 * Negative controls for the widget-suite flake repairs (flight `flakes`, 2026-09-08).
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Two roadmap rows, one file, one defect family: assertions that were
 * measuring something OTHER than the widget.
 *
 *   rm_widget-suite-flake  — `falls back to the render when the capture 404s` waited a flat 500ms
 *                            for a 404 plus a fallback load. 0, 0, then 2 failures across
 *                            identical runs.
 *   rm_suite-log-flakes    — three assertions read Sub's LIVE game.log: an exact row count, an
 *                            exact PAUSED tally, and a hauling fixture the sidecar's real board
 *                            replaced mid-suite (which surfaced as a nameless throw on
 *                            `trackedNow`). Measured while playing: 5-7 log lines a second.
 *
 * 🔴 THE ROADMAP ROW WARNS AGAINST THE FALSE CONCLUSION AND IT IS RIGHT: these did not fire in
 * either 6 Sep full pass, and that is NOT evidence they were fixed — nobody checked whether Star
 * Citizen was up when those runs began. Star Citizen is CLOSED as this is written, so a green run
 * here proves nothing either. That is the entire reason this file exists: the noise is SYNTHESISED
 * rather than waited for, which is both reproducible and stronger than catching Sub mid-session.
 *
 * 🔑 EVERY REPAIR IS CONTROLLED IN BOTH DIRECTIONS, or it is a tautology wearing a fix's clothes:
 *   - inject the noise the assertion must now tolerate  -> it must stay GREEN
 *   - inject the same noise with the OLD assertion back -> it must go RED  (or the green above is
 *     free, and "the repair tolerates noise" is indistinguishable from "no noise arrived")
 *   - inject the real regression the assertion exists to catch -> it must go RED
 *
 *   C1  log: a live feed at ~67 lines/sec, repaired assertions   -> all stay green
 *   C2  log: the same feed, with the old exact counts reinstated -> all three redden
 *   C3  log: the widget drops a line it was handed               -> "a line the game wrote appears"
 *   C4  log: the timestamp is stripped instead of dimmed         -> the raw-line + dimmed checks
 *   C5  log: the filter stops filtering                          -> "showing only what matched"
 *   C6  log: the freeze stops counting what arrives behind it    -> "says how many are waiting"
 *   C7  log: status() stops printing the figure it counted       -> same, by the other half
 *   C8  img: the fallback chain takes 900ms, repaired wait       -> stays green
 *   C9  img: the same 900ms chain, with the 500ms sleep back     -> reddens  (C8 was not free)
 *   C10 img: the fallback is never attempted at all              -> reddens
 *   C11 haul: an SSE frame lands mid-suite, load frozen          -> fixture survives, stays green
 *   C12 haul: the same frame with the freeze removed             -> reddens BY NAME, never a throw
 *
 * 🔴 EVERY RULE IN THE RUNNER WAS LEARNED THE EXPENSIVE WAY IN THIS REPO, so none is optional:
 *   - grade on the output TEXT, never the exit code (`test:widgets` has exited 0 while printing
 *     FAILED, and a wrapper reading `r.status` once announced GREEN above its own captured FAIL);
 *   - abort loudly on a NO-OP patch, or the suite runs on unmodified source and its green reads as
 *     "the control proves nothing is broken" — the exact conclusion a control exists to rule out;
 *   - require the suite to have produced assertions AND reached its own terminator, because a run
 *     that crashed part-way is indistinguishable from one that passed;
 *   - check WHICH assertion went red. A control that reddens a different one — especially a
 *     positive-first guard that is supposed to stay green — is a bug in the test, not evidence;
 *   - restore from a copy held IN MEMORY, never from git: these are the files being protected, and
 *     this repo has already lost a source file to a control runner that crashed mid-restore.

/* A timer standing in for Sub's running game, started AFTER the suite's own reset so the
   empty-panel guard still means something. 15ms is ~67 lines/sec against the 5-7/sec measured
   while playing, so it is a harder test than the real thing.
   🔑 The noise carries CObjectiveMarkerComponent::AddToPlayerDataBank on purpose: that is the
   exact token the filter block searches for, and it is what the game writes when Sub tracks a
   contract. Noise that avoided it would leave the filter assertions untested.
   🔴 15ms, NOT 60. Measured on the first run of this file: at 60ms nothing landed inside the
   40ms window after the suite pushes its two lines, so C2 reinstated the old `rowCount() === 2`
   and it stayed GREEN — i.e. the control could not express the failure and C1 was passing that
   assertion for free. A control has to be able to REACH every window it claims to cover. */

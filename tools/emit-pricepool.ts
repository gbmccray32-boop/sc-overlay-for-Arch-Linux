/**
 * poolfill — TURN THE SHARED-LOG CORPUS INTO POOL OBSERVATIONS.
 *
 * `tools/measure-pricemine.ts` proved the corpus is worth mining and printed the verdict. This is
 * the half that ACTS on it: same input, same two SHIPPED parsers, but it emits the rows the site's
 * backfill inserts into the price pool instead of a report.
 *
 *   npx tsx tools/emit-pricepool.ts <shoplines.b64> --out <observations.jsonl> [--stats]
 *
 * ── 🔴 THE CONTRIBUTOR NEVER LEAVES THE SERVER ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every row carries `logId` — the `site.bp_shared_logs` primary key — and nothing else about who
 * shared it. `owner_email` is populated on 900 of 900 rows and is what first-finder attribution is
 * built from, but resolving it is a JOIN the site does on the VPS. Pulling 57 real email addresses
 * onto a Windows dev box to compute an attribution that gets stored next to the log row they came
 * from would be moving PII for no reason at all.
 *
 * ── 🔴 A FRESH GATE PER LOG ROW, AND THE TWO GATES ARE INVERSES ────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Each `bp_shared_logs` row is one uploaded session — a complete rotated log, or the tail of a live
 * one — so the file boundary is real and `endOfStream()` applies. The gates then behave in OPPOSITE
 * directions and copying either rule to the other side books garbage:
 *
 *   · ITEMS      — an item shop answers every request, so commit ONLY on `result[Success]`.
 *                  `endOfStream()` confirms NOTHING; an unanswered request is abandoned.
 *   · COMMODITIES— a successful commodity trade emits no response at all (0 successes in 39
 *                  responses across the corpus), so commit UNLESS a refusal claims the request
 *                  inside the window, and `flush()` commits what is still held.
 *
 * ── 🔴 THE STREAM IS FILTERED, AND THAT IS A REAL CHANGE TO A GATE'S INPUT ─────────────────────
 *
 * The extract keeps only lines carrying a parser's exported marker, and both gates are documented
 * as wanting every line because the boring ones move their clock. It is safe here and it is checked
 * rather than asserted: a refusal and a `result[Success]` both carry their component's marker, so
 * neither gate can lose its evidence, and `tools/control-poolfill.ts` replays whole sessions BOTH
 * ways and requires the confirmed sets to be identical — then requires them to DIFFER once the
 * server's answer lines are dropped, so the agreement is not free.
 *
 * ── 🔴 WHAT IS AND IS NOT A PRICE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `unitSource` is carried on every row and the site publishes only `stated`:
 *
 *   · an item BUY   — `client_price` is the STACK TOTAL and the log states an exact integer
 *                     quantity, so `total / quantity` is arithmetic on two stated numbers.
 *                     Recorded as `stated`.
 *   · a commodity BUY  — the shop states `shopPricePerCentiSCU` outright. `stated`.
 *   · a commodity SELL — states no unit price, and flight `gemmass` proved the `Cargo Box Data`
 *                     figure is the crate's CAPACITY rather than its contents, so `total / volume`
 *                     is a FLOOR (median 0.790 of the truth, i.e. a typical estimate runs 21% low).
 *                     Recorded as `derived`, stored, and NOT published as a price. Sub's ruling for
 *                     this slice is that only what was observed may be shown.

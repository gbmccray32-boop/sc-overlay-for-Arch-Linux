/**
 * DOES A SHOP TERMINAL TELL US WHERE THE PLAYER IS? — the measurement that answered "no".
 *
 *   node tools/measure-terminal-origin.mjs [pathToTheGAMEFolder]
 *
 * Sub asked, 2026-08-23: "now that I've been going to these terminals to buy things, I want you to
 * see if we can determine where a person is when they interact with these terminals." The proposal
 * was a new `place` tier for `src/player-origin.ts`, learned from `shopName` co-occurring with a
 * location line and persisted across sessions, because `shopName` is stable where `shopId` is not.
 *
 * 🔴 THE ANSWER IS THAT THE FIX IS REAL AND THE TIER IS WORTHLESS, AND THOSE ARE NOT THE SAME
 * SENTENCE. A terminal does place you — to the station, reliably. It buys nothing because
 * **you cannot reach a terminal without the app having already placed you**: the terminal is
 * inside a station, and getting inside one fires an inventory, an ASOP or a freight lift first.
 * Measured over Sub's whole log history, a shop line was NEVER the first thing to place him in a
 * session. Not rarely — never, 0 of 727.
 *
 * This file exists so nobody re-derives that. Re-run it after a patch, or against a different
 * player's logs, and it will say whether the conclusion still holds. What would OVERTURN it is a
 * non-zero "cold open" count: a terminal touched before any location line in that session.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT READS THE GAME'S LOGS AND WRITES NOTHING. Read-only by construction — it opens
 * `game.log` and every file in `logbackups/` and prints. No state, no network, no game files
 * touched. It is a measurement, not part of the app.

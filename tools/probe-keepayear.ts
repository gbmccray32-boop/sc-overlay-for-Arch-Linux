/**
 * keepayear — WHAT A ONE-YEAR RETENTION WINDOW COSTS, AND WHICH CLOCK TO MEASURE IT WITH.
 *
 * `src/log-share.ts` caps a contributor's history at the CURRENT SC PATCH. That is the only
 * client-side history limit in this repo (the `live=5 / backup=25` quota is the site's, not
 * ours), and it is why a player with two years of `logbackups/` offers about six weeks of them.
 *
 * Sub's ruling is one year. Three separate things have to be measured before that can be built:
 *
 *  1. WHICH CLOCK. A backup states its age three ways and they are not the same fact:
 *       - the log's own first line, `<2026-08-23T22:10:48.704Z>` — the game's UTC session START;
 *       - the FILENAME, `Game Build(12344265) 23 Aug 26 (17 10 39).log` — LOCAL time, no offset;
 *       - the file's MTIME — the session END, and filesystem metadata besides.
 *     Agreement between them is measured here rather than assumed.
 *
 *  2. WHAT IT COSTS. How many more sessions a year admits, how many of those carry signal and
 *     therefore actually upload, and how many bytes that is AFTER scrub + tail — which is the
 *     only number the site ever sees.
 *
 *  3. WHERE THE OLD VERDICTS SIT. A rules-version reset re-opens `backups` and `skippedPatch`.
 *     For a SIGNAL widening (flight sharefilter) the recoverable sessions were in `backups`.
 *     A WINDOW widening is a different rule, so the answer may be different — and guessing it is
 *     how this change silently does nothing for every existing user.
 *
 * Needs Star Citizen installed. Reads only; writes nothing, uploads nothing.
 *
 * Usage:  npx tsx tools/probe-keepayear.ts [logbackups dir] [shared-logs.json]
 *         npm run probe:keepayear

/**
 * Negative controls for flight `orisonfix`.
 *
 * A green test is not evidence until it can go red. Each control below re-injects the exact
 * behaviour that was fixed, runs the suite that is supposed to catch it, and requires that suite
 * to FAIL **naming the assertion we expect**. A control that reddens a different assertion is a
 * bug in the test, not proof of coverage.
 *
 * Three rules this runner follows, each of which has burned this repo before:
 *  - GRADE ON THE OUTPUT TEXT (`FAIL `), never on the exit code.
 *  - ABORT LOUDLY ON A NO-OP PATCH. A `replace()` whose anchor does not match rewrites the file
 *    unchanged, the suite then runs on pristine source and prints "all passed" — which reads as
 *    "the control proves nothing is broken", the exact conclusion a working control rules out.
 *  - REQUIRE THE SUITE TO HAVE REPORTED SOMETHING. A suite that produced no assertions at all
 *    (a parse error, a bad spawn) is a broken control, never a passing one.
 *
 * Restores are from an IN-MEMORY copy taken before the first patch, not from git: a runner that
 * crashes mid-restore must not be able to leave a mutilated source file behind, and this repo has
 * lost a source file that way once already.
 *
 * Run with:  npm run control:orisonfix

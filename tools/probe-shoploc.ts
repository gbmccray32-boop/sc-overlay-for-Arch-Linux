/**
 * WHICH TERMINAL IS `SCShop_Orison_KelTo`? — resolved by WHERE THE PLAYER WAS STANDING.
 *
 *   npx tsx tools/probe-shoploc.ts --lines <lines.gz> --meta <meta.csv> [--out <file.json>]
 *   npm run probe:shoploc -- --lines E:/tmp/shoploc/lines.gz --meta E:/tmp/shoploc/meta.csv
 *
 * -- THE PROBLEM -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * The game writes a shop as an ASSET NAME (`SCShop_Orison_KelTo`); UEX writes it as a TERMINAL
 * NAME (`Kel-To - Cloudview Center - Orison`). **0 of 75 join by string.** Name-parsing gets part
 * of the way and then hits two walls that are structural rather than lazy:
 *
 *   - `SCShop_Cargo_Office`   ONE token, THIRTEEN stations. No string can separate them.
 *   - `SCShop_Orison_KelTo`   Orison has TWO Kel-To kiosks (Cloudview Center, August Dunlow
 *                             Spaceport). The name names the city, not the shop.
 *
 * So this does not read the token. It replays the corpus through the app's OWN location service
 * and asks, at each shop line, where the log had already placed the player.
 *
 * -- 🔴 THE RULE THAT KEEPS THIS FROM POISONING THE MAP ----------------------------------------
 *
 * **ONLY A `place`-TIER VERDICT MAY RESOLVE A TOKEN.** `body` and `system` name somewhere the
 * player was NEAR, not where they were standing, and a previous attempt at a learned
 * `shopName -> place` map had **5 of 27 pairings poisoned** at a 300 s window for exactly that
 * reason. A token seen at two different places is recorded as PLACE-DEPENDENT, never resolved —
 * `SCShop_Cargo_Office` SHOULD come out that way, and if it does not, the pipeline is wrong.
 *
 * 🔑 A token this refuses to resolve is a better result than one it resolves wrongly. A wrong
 * terminal silently attributes a price to a shop that never charged it.
 *
 * -- 🔴 THE CIRCULARITY GUARD, and it is the whole reason this measurement means anything -------
 *
 * `collectOriginSignals` ALREADY reads a place out of the shop's own asset name
 * (`uniqueFromShopName`) and already carries an in-session `shopId -> place` binding. Feeding the
 * terminal in and then "discovering" that `SCShop_Orison_KelTo` is at Orison would be the name
 * parse wearing a lab coat: the answer would come from the token being graded.
 *
 * So `inputs.terminal` is DELETED before grading. Every verdict here rests only on inventory
 * lines, ASOP reads, freight moves, the terrain report and quantum routes — sources that know
 * nothing about the shop. `--with-terminal` puts it back, and the difference is reported, because
 * a guard whose removal changes nothing is not a guard.
 *
 * -- THE CORPUS, AND ITS THREE TRAPS -----------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * `site.bp_shared_logs`, read-only. The published properties of that table all bite here:
 *
 *   1. **IT DOUBLE-COUNTS.** A live log is re-uploaded on every tick whose content changed, so one
 *      session arrives as N rows each a superset of the last. Every observation is therefore keyed
 *      on `(contributor, the GAME's own millisecond timestamp, token)` — never on the row.
 *   2. **IT IS FILTERED.** Sessions stored before 2026-08-24 were gathered under a `RE_SIGNAL`
 *      with no price term, so shopping sessions are under-represented. That biases COVERAGE, not
 *      correctness: a session that is present is present whole.
 *   3. **THE LINE EXTRACT IS A FILTER OF A FILTER.** Only the lines the location parsers consume
 *      are pulled. That is a real change to a stateful parser's input, so it is proven rather
 *      than assumed — see `--control`, which replays 8 WHOLE logs both ways and requires the
 *      verdict sequences to be identical field for field.
 *
 * 🔴 `PlaceWatcher` IS THE STATEFUL ONE, and the filter would have broken it silently. A terrain
 * block ends when a NON-terrain line arrives; drop the intervening lines and two blocks merge into
 * one, losing a reading and misdating the survivor. The extract carries each line's ORDINAL, so a
 * synthetic terminator is injected wherever the ordinals are not contiguous — which reconstructs
 * the block boundary exactly. The control is what says so.
 *
 * -- 🔴 A SYSTEM READING CAN BE A JUMP OUT OF DATE, AND IT NEVER SAYS SO --------------------
 *
 * `SystemWatcher` reads `[QuantumTravel]` lines and is given an INFINITE trust window on the
 * reasoning that you cannot leave a system without a jump, and a jump writes more of those lines.
 * `travel.md` separately records that **the wormhole emits no route event**. Put together: a player
 * who quantums in Stanton, jumps to Nyx and shops at Levski keeps reporting **Stanton** until they
 * next touch a drive on the far side.
 *
 * Measured here, and the concentration is the proof: **11 of 83 tokens carry an observation whose
 * system disagrees with the place the same token resolves to, and 8 of them are Levski — 475 of the
 * 496 contradicting observations, 95.8%.** Levski is the only place in this corpus that requires a
 * jump to reach.
 *
 * 🔑 THE COMPETING EXPLANATION WAS RULED OUT RATHER THAN ARGUED AWAY. `SystemWatcher.push`
 * iterates its `known` SET and takes the first name that matches anywhere in the line, so a line
 * naming two systems resolves by Set insertion order rather than by which system the player is in —
 * which would produce this same signature at exactly this place. It cannot be the cause here: only
 * **89 of 150,840** QuantumTravel lines in the corpus name two systems (**0.06%**). It remains a
 * real latent bug; it is simply not this one.
 *
 * ⚠️ WHAT IT MEANS FOR THIS FILE: the ladder prefers the finest tier, so a place fix wins and
 * naming is unaffected. `location.contradictions` carries the count so a consumer can see it, and a
 * `system`-tier location is the one to read with this in mind.
 *
 * ⚠️ READ-ONLY. It reads a gzip and two JSON datasets and writes one report. It touches no game
 * install, no `%APPDATA%`, and nothing on the server.

 * same-BODY readings wearing a place-tier coat, and letting them resolve a token is precisely the
 * poisoning this probe exists to avoid — `SCShop_ht_delta_rayari_m_store` would have "resolved"
 * to two moons, naming neither of the outposts on them.
 *
 * `tierOfRecord` already encodes the rule (it is what stops a shop name mentioning "Pyro" from
 * putting the player at the centre of a sun); it simply is not applied on this path. Applying it
 * here is a measurement guard, not a fix — see the strip's Cargo for the `src/` half.
 *
 * 🔴 AND THE TIER IS NOT ENOUGH ON ITS OWN EITHER — `resolveOrigin` FALLS BACK TO AN EXPIRED
 * READING AND STILL CALLS IT `place`. That fallback is right for a widget (a last-known beats
 * "unknown" on screen, and it ships `stale: true` beside it) and wrong here: a fix older than its
 * own trust window is a claim about where the player was an hour ago, and an hour is enough to fly
 * to another station. That is the wrong-attribution case this whole probe exists to avoid.
 *
 * Measured before adding the guard: **64 of 3,062 same-place observations (2.1%) were past
 * `TRUST_MIN.place`**, and nothing anywhere in the corpus rested on a reading older than 180
 * minutes — so closing the branch that could be badly wrong costs almost nothing.
 *
 * ⚠️ The merely-`stale` ones are KEPT — 303 (9.9%) sit past HALF the window. Half a window is
 * "believe it less", not "it is probably wrong", and `resolveOrigin`'s own comment says so.
 *
 * 🔑 **A REJECTED PLACE IS NOT A REJECTED LOCATION, and reading it as one was too narrow.** Every
 * branch below still knows something true and coarser: a fix on the Moon "Ita" is a genuine BODY
 * reading, a fix on the Star "Stanton" is a genuine SYSTEM one, and a place fix past its window
 * still pins the SYSTEM — you cannot leave a system without a jump, and `resolveOrigin`'s own
 * contradiction check means no newer system reading disagrees with the one that won. So this
 * returns BOTH: the same-place id (which alone may NAME a shop) and `loc`, the finest tier the
 * observation can defend (which may only PLACE and SORT one). See `TokenReport.outcome`.

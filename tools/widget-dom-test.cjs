// Suite 1 runs with no shell API (fresh install) and exercises grouping.

//
// ⚠️ EVERY SUITE BODY IS A TEMPLATE LITERAL, so a backtick anywhere inside one — including in a
// comment, e.g. quoting a variable name the way the rest of this codebase does — ENDS the string and
// the whole file fails to parse. That failure is easy to miss: `npm run test:widgets` exits 0 and
// prints an "App threw an error during load" stack instead of any assertions, so a run that tested
// NOTHING reads as a quiet success. Use plain words inside a suite; `node --check` catches it.

/* ── `--only <widget>[,<widget>]` — run the suites a change can actually have broken ────────────
 *
 * 🔴 THE FULL PASS IS THE DEFAULT AND MUST STAY THE DEFAULT. This is a flight's tool for the loop
 * it runs twenty times an afternoon; the landing gate still runs everything. Passing no `--only`
 * changes nothing about which suites execute.
 *
 * 🔑 WHY IT IS WORTH HAVING, AS A NUMBER RATHER THAN A FEELING (measured 2026-08-25, 52 suites,
 * 1,364 assertions, 324.9s): assertion count is NOT cost. `chat links + slash menu` runs 220
 * assertions in 1.1s; `pair merges (brute force)` runs SEVEN in 134.4s — 41% of the whole pass —
 * because it is O(n²) over a 15-widget registry (105 pairs). So a subset that merely skips other
 * widgets' PAGES saves ~15%; the win only arrives when the registry SWEEPS narrow too, which is
 * why `only` is pushed into the page and read by the two expensive ones.
 *
 * The selection rule, and it errs toward running things:
 *   · a suite tagged with a named widget runs;
 *   · EVERY registry-sweeping suite runs regardless (they are the ones that host the widget in the
 *     canvas — a page that stops fitting its box shows up there and nowhere else), but PAIRS and
 *     SWEEPS narrow their loops to the named widgets;
 *   · a single-purpose SHELL suite (patch notes, setup nudge, the service-down banner) is skipped,
 *     because no widget page can reach it;
 *   · a suite carrying no tag at all RUNS, and is named in a failure at the end of the pass. Never
 *     skip something you could not classify — but do not let it go unnoticed either, or `--only`
 *     silently rots as suites are added.

/* ── `--pairs` — the brute-force pair merge is a RELEASE step, not a landing gate ───────────────
 *
 * 🔴 SUB'S CALL, 2026-08-25, AND IT IS A DECISION RATHER THAN AN OVERSIGHT.
 *   "That seems like something we might be able to just do one time just before an actual
 *    release... I'm fine with the downside to waiting that long to see if things merge. I think
 *    it'll far outweigh the amount of time wasted by just sitting there waiting for that script
 *    to be run."
 *
 * The numbers behind it (flight `suiteaudit`, three passes on one tree): `pair merges (brute
 * force)` is 134s of a 325s pass — 41% — for SEVEN assertions, because it is O(n²) over the
 * registry (15 widgets = 105 pairs at ~1.28s each). Every widget added to the app adds ~15 pairs,
 * i.e. ~19s to EVERY landing, forever.
 *
 * 🔑 WHY THE RELEASE IS THE RIGHT MOMENT: a broken merge pair can only ever reach a human through
 * a released build. Landings on `main` ship to nobody, so nothing is at risk between the landing
 * and the release — only the debugging DISTANCE grows, and Sub accepted that knowingly.
 *
 * ⚠️ IT WAS ALSO PROPOSED THAT THIS RUN WHENEVER THE DIFF TOUCHED THE REGISTRY, THE GROUPING CODE
 * OR A WIDGET'S PANEL SIZING. Sub considered that and DECLINED it. Do not add a trigger condition.
 *
 * 🔴 OPT-IN, NEVER `--no-pairs`. A release step that has to remember a negative flag is a step
 * that gets skipped, and the failure is silent — the flag simply is not typed and nobody notices
 * the suite did not run. `npm run test:widgets:release` is the whole ritual.

  /* 🔴 RE-POINTED 2026-08-25, flight suiteaudit. It demanded exactly FIVE survey rows on every
     truncated card, and the shipped design promises no such thing - in TWO directions, both of
     them deliberate and both documented in the code it was testing:

       FEWER - verse-routes.ts folds community confirmations in BEFORE the ordering, so the cap
       applies to the MERGED list. A card with one placed confirmation draws 4 survey + 1 obs.
       Measured the day this was re-pointed: 3 of the 11 truncated cannon cards.

       MORE - reserveTierRows (verse-proximity.ts) keeps each containment tier best row past the
       cap. versefinder.html says so in as many words: "a card can legitimately draw 6 or 7".
       MedPen drew 6 the same afternoon.

     It only went red now because the price pool filled: when poolfill re-pointed it, no cannon
     card carried a placed row, so counting survey rows still gave 5 and the wrong claim looked
     right. Data drift was the trigger; the assertion was the fault.

     🔑 THE REPAIR IS TO COMPARE THE RENDER TO ITS OWN INPUT, not to a magic number. Ask the
     sidecar the same question the widget asked and check the card against the answer: it cannot
     drift with the corpus, and it still catches the exact regression poolfill was guarding - a
     note computed from the ROWS ON SCREEN rather than from the survey quotes would be too small
     by precisely the number of community rows in the card. */

  /* 🔴 A THIRD PARTY BEING DOWN MUST NEVER REDDEN THIS REPO'S SUITE. An assertion that can go red
     for reasons outside the repo teaches people to ignore the suite, and this one had started to.
     On 2026-08-25 FrankerFaceZ's origin went down behind Cloudflare, and every load of the Twitch
     Chat widget put two CORS errors on the console. Whether they landed inside a given suite's
     observation window depended on how long that suite happened to run, so the same unmodified
     tree measured GREEN once and RED twice (2 and 5 failures) across three runs — which makes the
     suite useless as a landing gate for every other flight.

     🔑 THE RULE IS BY HOST, NOT BY VENDOR. It used to be three named emote domains, and that is
     the same trap one release later: the next outage is at some host nobody thought to list, and
     whoever is unlucky then has to rediscover all of this. A failure whose subject is not served
     by this repo is out of scope, whoever it belongs to.

     🔑 This is the BELT. The widget side of that outage is fixed properly and separately — every
     emote provider is proxied through the sidecar now (`/api/emotes`), so these pages make no
     cross-origin request at all. This filter keeps a host we do not own from grading our work if
     something ever reaches for one again. Both layers exist on purpose, so a negative control has

  /* ── 🔴 A PILL WRAPS AS A PILL, OR NOT AT ALL (Sub, 2026-08-22) ─────────────────────────────
     Measured on the Runs tab at 440px, the widget's DEFAULT width: the chip row was a block of
     inline spans, so the ONLY break opportunities the engine had were the spaces inside each
     pill's own label. "costs 851k" put its left half at x=290 on line one and its right half at
     x=39 on line two - one bordered box sawn in half - and it overflowed by four pixels.

     🔑 SYNTHETIC, ON PURPOSE. The real Runs rows need a live commodity table, so an assertion
     over them would pass or fail on whether this machine has trade data - the same rot as the
     assertion that once depended on how recently Sub had played. The rules under test are pure
     CSS, so they are driven against pills built here.

     🔴 TWO PROBES, BECAUSE THE FIX IS TWO INDEPENDENT MECHANISMS AND EACH MUST BE TESTED WHERE IT
     IS LOAD-BEARING. The first attempt put both in one flex probe and the nowrap control came back
     GREEN - correctly, because a FLEX ITEM is blockified and the parent cannot break it however
     its white-space is set. That assertion was testing flex while claiming to test nowrap. So:
       - the nowrap rule matters in the INLINE chip rows that are still around (the Ledger totals,
         the route cards) - probe A gives it one of those.
       - the flex rule matters in the Runs row - probe B gives it that, and its control (flex
         removed) puts three unbreakable pills on one line running off the edge.

//   step's own tonnage line, and the hold/peak readings, which become FLOORS for the whole trip.

// 🔴 Suite: ONE FLAT TAB ROW, AND THE CREDIT FOLLOWS THE DATA (2026-08-23).
//
// The widget had two MODES with a bottom switch, each owning its own tabs, because there were two
// Route surfaces - contracts in Hauling, commodity runs in Trading. Merging Route into one
// cargo-agnostic tab removed the reason for the split, so the modes went and the five tabs became
// one row. Two things then have to be pinned, and they fail in completely different ways:
//
//  1. THE ROW ITSELF. Sub chose "Commodities" over "Planner" knowing it wraps to two lines at the
//     320px minimum (measured: the row is 296px, five tabs need 328.8px). So the assertion is NOT
//     "it fits" - it is that wrapping is what happens and the PAGE still does not scroll sideways.
//     A row that overflowed instead of wrapping would leave a tab unreachable at minW.
//  2. THE UEX CREDIT. It used to live in the mode bar and show in Trading mode. The bar is gone
//     and the credit could not go with it: UEX's data is on the Commodities tab, and an
//     attribution has to be present where the data is. Both halves are asserted - present there,
//     absent everywhere else - because "not shown on Route" is satisfied for free by a credit that
//     never shows at all, which is the exact regression that would strip the attribution.
//
// 🔑 VISIBILITY IS READ FROM COMPUTED display, NEVER from `el.hidden`. `.creditbar` sets
// display:flex, and a bare `hidden` attribute loses to any class rule setting display - so an
// assertion starting at `.hidden` would stay green with the `[hidden]` guard deleted and the
// credit painted on every tab. That guard is load-bearing and the control proves it.

//
// What shipped before it: the money line was one white-space:nowrap flex row inside a column
// that shrinks, and #body is overflow-x:hidden. MEASURED against the live board at 320px (the
// widget minW, and about as narrow as Sub runs it): ALL 25 rows clipped, the line needing
// 254-273px of a 175-204px column. It kept buy and sell and threw away the margin and the
// quantity, and nothing on screen said so.
//
// 🔑 The assertion is about the MECHANISM, not one string: the strip may wrap, and nothing in a
// row may exceed the column it sits in. A check on particular text would pass the day someone
// re-added nowrap with slightly shorter numbers.
//
// ⚠️ FIXTURE, deliberately. The rows are served by patching fetch rather than taken from the
// live price table, because this is a LAYOUT claim and a layout claim must not pass or fail on
// whether the sidecar happens to hold a cached UEX table. The fixture is built to stress the
// line: the longest real terminal names and the widest real numbers on the board.

// Sub picked this design out of three mockups on 2026-08-25. The property that makes it worth
// having is not the layout, it is that A PLACE THE COMMODITY CANNOT BE BOUGHT AT IS UNREACHABLE —
// the slot is filled from `buyAt`/`sellAt`, so there is no code path that offers one. That is the
// same bug the Route tab's picker has, and the reason both are meant to share one source.
//
// ⚠️ LIVE DATA, deliberately, and this is the opposite call from RUNSNARROW above. That suite makes
// a LAYOUT claim and fixtures its rows so the layout cannot pass or fail on the sidecar's cache.
// This one makes a claim about WHERE THE OPTIONS COME FROM, and a fixture would answer that
// question with a list the test itself wrote — the circularity trap. So it reads the real
// /api/trade/commodity for whatever commodity it picked and requires the slot to be a subset.
//

/**
 * REGENERATE `data/item-shops.json` — the Verse Finder's offline floor.
 *
 * 🔴 WHY THIS EXISTS. The bundle shipped as a HAND-CAPTURED snapshot: someone called the endpoint
 * once and pasted the response into the repo. That works exactly once. It has no script behind it,
 * so it ages silently, and the thing it ages into is the tier a player falls back to when they
 * have no network — the one case where nobody is watching. `verse` flagged this as the single
 * loose end it left; this is that loose end closed.
 *
 * Same reasoning as `check-dataset-fresh.mjs`, whose header says it best: a documented per-release
 * step with no alarm on it is a step that eventually gets skipped.
 *
 * -- WHERE THE DATA COMES FROM, and why not from UEX directly -------------------------------
 *
 * 🔴 THE UEX KEY MUST NEVER SHIP IN THE APP, which is why the site proxy exists at all. This
 * generator honours the same boundary for a second reason: the site's `lib/uex/items.ts` already
 * performs the `id_terminal` join, the offline-terminal drop and the catalogue merge. Pulling
 * from UEX here would be a SECOND implementation of that join, free to drift from the one the
 * live tier uses — and then the bundled tier and the live tier would answer differently, which is
 * precisely the bug the bundle exists to avoid. So: one join, on the site, and this reads its
 * output. No key is needed here and none should be added.
 *
 * -- THE SAFETY PROPERTY THAT MATTERS MOST -------------------------------------------------
 *
 * 🔴 `ItemShopStore` REJECTS A MALFORMED TABLE **WHOLE** — `normalise()` returning null yields
 * `emptyTable("bundled")`, not a partial one. So a bundle this script gets subtly wrong does not
 * degrade, it VANISHES: the app ships with no offline data and says only "bundled, 0 items".
 * A generator that can write such a file is worse than no generator.
 *
 * 🔑 The defence is NOT to re-implement `normalise()`'s rules here — a copy is free to drift from
 * the original, and drift is the whole failure mode. Instead this script writes the file and then
 * loads it back through the REAL `ItemShopStore`, asserting the table comes out populated with the
 * counts we expect. What is verified is the actual runtime path, so it cannot disagree with it.
 *
 * -- USAGE ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *   npm run build:itemshops              # fetch, verify, write data/item-shops.json
 *   npm run build:itemshops -- --check   # write nothing; report how far behind the bundle is
 *   npm run check:itemshops              # the above, --strict (exit 1 when stale) — for release
 *
 *   --url <u>   read from somewhere else (a local site dev server, a staging deploy)
 *   --force     write even when the regression guard objects. Say why in the commit.

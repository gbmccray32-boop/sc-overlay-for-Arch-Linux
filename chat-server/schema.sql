-- SC Overlay chat — Postgres schema (Timescale instance, `chat` schema, role chat_app).
--
-- Scrollback used to be an in-memory ring per room, so every Coolify redeploy silently wiped
-- every conversation in every channel. It also made DMs pointless: a message to someone who is
-- offline has to survive until they come back, and nothing here survived a restart.
--
-- Idempotent — safe to re-run. The server applies it on boot when DATABASE_URL is set.
--
-- 🔑 Table names are UNQUALIFIED on purpose: the pool sets search_path from CHAT_DB_SCHEMA
-- (default `chat`), so the same file builds a scratch schema for the store test. Hard-coding
-- `chat.` here would mean the Postgres path could only ever be exercised against live chat.

-- 🔴 THESE MUST BE `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`, NOT extra lines in the CREATE
-- above. `rooms` already exists in production, so `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` is a NO-OP there

-- for every listing field and the whole feature would look broken on the live server while
-- passing every test against a fresh scratch schema.
--
-- A party listing IS a room, not a separate entity: it inherits membership, invites, the join
-- code, scrollback, presence, the pin and moderation. These columns are the only thing a
-- listing adds.
--   is_party   this room is advertising for members; plain chat rooms stay false
--   location   free text, or the leader's real region if they opted in when creating
--   size_max   headcount they want; the live count comes from presence, not from here
--   join_mode  'open'  anyone may walk in
--              'apply' they ask first and the owner accepts (accepting reuses the invite path)
--   voice      'none' | 'optional' | 'required' — expectation only; we host no voice

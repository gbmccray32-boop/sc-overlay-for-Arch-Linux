/**
 * WHERE IS THE PLAYER — HARVESTING THE SIGNALS `player-origin.ts` GRADES.
 *
 * `player-origin.ts` decides how much to believe a set of readings. It does not go and get them;
 * this does. The split is deliberate — the grading rules are testable arithmetic, while the
 * harvest is a pile of log-shaped special cases, and mixing them makes neither reviewable.
 *
 * -- WHAT ACTUALLY EXISTS, and what each one is worth ----------------------------------------
 *
 * 🔴 THE GAME NEVER SAYS "THE PLAYER IS AT (x, y, z)". There is no player-position line in
 * `game.log` — three separate sessions have now looked. Every signal below is a side effect of
 * the player DOING something, which has one consequence that governs this whole module:
 *
 * 🔴 NOTHING FIRES WHEN THE PLAYER LEAVES. Every reading is a last-known, never a current
 * position, and it can only ever decay by assumption. That is why `player-origin.ts` carries a
 * trust window per tier rather than a single freshness rule, and why this module stamps every
 * signal with the time the LOG said it happened rather than the time we parsed it.
 *
 *   ASOP / inventory / freight  a NAMED PLACE. The strongest tier, and the only one that can be
 *                               specific enough to route from. Fires when you open a terminal.
 *   Terrain report              a BODY, every 10 minutes, but only while near one. The one signal
 *                               that fires ON ITS OWN — everything else needs the player to act.
 *                               🔴 It carries NO coordinates: it is `cells`, `meshes` and a name.
 *   Quantum navigation          the SYSTEM. You cannot leave a system without a jump, and a jump
 *                               writes more of these, so it does not decay.
 *
 * 🔑 A COARSER, NEWER READING IS NOT AN UPGRADE — it is evidence you MOVED. `resolveOrigin`
 * handles that (a "near Daymar" after an "at Area18" means the Area18 fix is wrong, not merely
 * old). This module's job is only to report each reading honestly and let it judge.
 *
 * -- AN UNRESOLVABLE TOKEN PRODUCES NO SIGNAL ------------------------------------------------
 *
 * 🔴 Not a signal with a guessed id. `hauling-locations.ts` already states the rule this follows:
 * "an ambiguous match resolves to NOTHING, because putting the player at the wrong outpost is
 * worse than not knowing". A signal we cannot place is silently useless; a signal placed WRONG
 * makes the widget confidently order shops around a location the player has never been to.

/**
 * 🔴 `RR_JP_<A><B>` IS THE R&R RING AT THE A–B JUMP POINT — resolved through the STARMAP'S OWN
 * PARENT LINK, never through the token's words.
 *
 * Sub, standing at the Nyx-side gateway on 2026-08-25: *"Currently right now, the widget says that
 * I'm at `RR_JP_NyxCastra`."* Two separate things were wrong, and this is the second — the first is
 * the tier bug in `pushPlace` above.
 *
 * 🔴 WHY NO NAMING HEURISTIC CAN WORK HERE, and this is the transferable part. **CIG named the
 * asset for a game that has not shipped.** `RR_JP_NyxCastra` is the ring at the Nyx–Castra jump
 * point; Castra does not exist yet, so today that ring IS the route to Stanton and UEX calls it
 * *Stanton Gateway (Nyx)*. When Castra ships, the station converts and Nyx→Stanton reroutes through
 * Pyro. The asset name is not a mistake to be corrected — it is accurate about a future game. The
 * starmap agrees and carries the same future state (`Terra Gateway` and `Magnus Gateway Clinic`
 * both sit in Stanton for systems that do not exist).
 *
 * ✅ SO THE ANSWER COMES FROM A LINK, NOT A STRING. `locations.json` carries the jump point as an
 * `Anomaly` and PARENTS it to the station that serves it:
 *
 *     Nyx System   Nyx - Castra Jump Point   -> parent "Stanton Gateway"  (Manmade)  ✅
 *     Nyx System   Nyx - Pyro Jump Point     -> parent "Pyro Gateway"     (Manmade)  ✅
 *     Pyro System  Pyro-Stanton Jump Point   -> parent "Stanton Gateway"  (Manmade)  ✅
 *     Stanton Sys  Stanton-Pyro Jump Point   -> parent "Pyro Gateway"     (Manmade)  ✅
 *     Pyro System  Pyro - Nyx Jump Point     -> parent "Pyro"             (Star)     ✗ refused
 *     Pyro System  Jump Point Pyro Castra    -> parent "Pyro"             (Star)     ✗ refused
 *
 * ⚠️ SO IT COVERS 4 OF THE 6 REAL RINGS AND REFUSES THE OTHER TWO, rather than reaching for a
 * second-best answer. The two it refuses have a gateway station in the data (`Nyx Gateway` really
 * is in Pyro System) — it is only the PARENT LINK that is missing, and inventing the join from the
 * names is the exact move the paragraph above rules out. A refusal here costs a friendly label; a
 * guess would put the player in the wrong system, which for the travel model is the largest error
 * it can make.
 *
 * 🔑 The parent must be a `place` by `tierOfRecord` — a jump point parented to its STAR carries no
 * more information than the system reading we already have, and returning it would dress a system
 * up as a station. Same rule as everywhere else in this module: the record decides.
 *
 * 🔑 "jumppoint" is stripped from the row's key rather than matched around, because the three
 * spellings in the shipped data (`Nyx - Castra Jump Point`, `Pyro-Stanton Jump Point`, `Jump Point
 * Pyro Castra`) put it in three different positions. Stripping it makes all three land on the
 * ordered pair, which is the only part the token states. It does NOT collide with `Stanton-Pyro
 * Jump Point Wreck Site`, whose key keeps `wrecksite`.

/**
 * Read a place out of a shop's own asset name.
 *
 * 🔑 THE INDEPENDENT SOURCE. Every other signal in this module comes from the game telling us where

 * writing the others. Measured over 533 logs: **28 of 61 distinct shop names resolve to exactly one
 * starmap row and 0 resolve ambiguously**, covering 1,873 of 2,549 shop lines.
 *
 * 🔴 EXACTLY ONE ROW, ACROSS THE WHOLE NAME, OR NOTHING. A shop name is several words and more than
 * one may be a row; two rows means the name has not identified a place and the module's standing
 * rule applies — an ambiguous match resolves to nothing, because putting the player at the wrong
 * outpost is worse than not knowing. ⚠️ **No shipped shop name does this today** (0 of 61 resolve
 * ambiguously), so the rule is exercised by the suite on a synthetic name rather than by a real
 * one — a must-not-happen assertion whose subject is absent from the corpus is free forever.
 *
 * ⚠️ Words shorter than four characters are skipped. They are initials and codes (`H`, `XS`, `lt`,
 * `FW`) and matching them against a 2,000-row name table is how a two-letter shop prefix becomes a
 * confident claim about an outpost.
 *
 * 🔑 WHICH RULE STOPS THE MEASURED OFFENDER, because the obvious answer is the wrong one and the
 * suite's control says so. `SCShop_AdminOffice_Nyx_SocialStation` sits at three different Keeger
 * bases and is what killed the persisted map. It is **the four-character guard** that stops it —
 * "Nyx" is three characters and is never looked up, while "AdminOffice" and "SocialStation" are not
 * rows at all. Lowering that guard would not break it either: "Nyx" is a `Star`, so `tierOfRecord`
 * would report a SYSTEM and still never a place. Two independent mechanisms, and a control that
 * removes one comes back green — enumerate both before writing one.

/**
 * The shared travel model — `npx tsx src/travel-model.test.ts`.
 *
 * Driven against the REAL shipped data, because every claim here is a property of that data and a
 * fixture would keep passing after CIG renamed a gateway. The headline case cannot even be
 * expressed against a fixture: "Stanton's Nyx Gateway is really the Magnus one" is only a fact
 * about `locations.json` + `locations-xyz`, and inventing a fixture that says so would be
 * asserting my own assumption back at myself.
 *
 * 🔴 THE TWO THINGS THIS FILE EXISTS TO STOP:
 *   1. Believing a gateway's NAME. Two of the seven lie, and trusting them invents a one-jump
 *      Stanton <-> Nyx route the game does not have.
 *   2. Quoting a travel time as fact when part of it is a guess. The jump is an estimate; a route
 *      containing one is an estimate all the way through.

/**
 * ONE LIST — the fold, the placement, and the refusals that keep both honest.
 *
 * `npm run test:onerow`. Everything here is about flight `onerow`'s central claim: a community
 * confirmation is either part of a shop row or a row of its own, and never a second list.
 *
 * 🔴 EVERY CONTROL IN THIS FILE IS INLINE AND RUNS EVERY TIME, the shape `test:trade` uses. A
 * control kept in a scratch file rots the first time somebody edits the code it guards; one that
 * lives in the suite cannot. Each is marked CONTROL and says which regression it re-injects.
 *
 * 🔴 AND EVERY "MUST NOT" IS PRECEDED BY A "MUST". The most expensive false pass on this project
 * is an assertion satisfied by an empty set — `assert(!rows.some(bad))` is free when there are no
 * rows, and the bug being guarded against is frequently what empties them. So each block asserts
 * the set is non-empty FIRST.

/**
 * VERSE FINDER - COMMODITIES, ADAPTED INTO SEARCH HITS.
 *
 * 🔴 THE DATA WAS ALREADY ON THE PLAYER'S MACHINE AND THE WIDGET REFUSED TO LOOK AT IT.
 * `trade-prices.ts` has been keeping `%APPDATA%/sc-blueprint-tracker/trade-prices.json` current for
 * the Trade widget - 2,572 quotes over 122 commodities as measured on Sub's own install - while
 * typing "Laranite" into the Verse Finder produced the same blank as a typo. The exclusion was
 * deliberate and its reasoning was sound (`item-shops.ts` is about shop ITEMS, and a commodity is a
 * genuinely different kind of row); it was simply being applied to the wrong thing. The DATA stays
 * separate. The QUESTION does not: "where is it and what does it cost" is one question and it
 * deserves one box.
 *
 * -- WHY SEARCH THEM HERE RATHER THAN POINT AT THE TRADE WIDGET -----------------------------
 *
 * Both were on the table. Search-here wins on what a player is doing at the moment they type:
 *
 *   · THE TWO WIDGETS ANSWER DIFFERENT QUESTIONS. Trade ranks round TRIPS by profit per hour and
 *     needs to know your ship - it is a planning tool you open before you undock. The Verse Finder
 *     answers a lookup: where is this, what does it cost. A player who is already flying and wants
 *     to know where Laranite is cheap is asking the second question, not the first.
 *   · A POINTER COSTS THE THING THE WIDGET IS FOR. Sub's whole framing is "hit a hotkey, type in
 *     the item". Answering with "open another widget and type it again" spends the hotkey, the
 *     typing and the player's attention to deliver a redirect - over a game, mid-flight.
 *   · IT CANNOT DRIFT. There is one commodity table in the process. Both widgets read it, so they
 *     can never disagree about a price, which is the same reasoning that keeps the dealer join on
 *     the site rather than in the app.
 *
 * 🔑 SELLING IS STILL THE TRADE WIDGET'S JOB, and that boundary is where the honest split falls.
 * This module surfaces BUY quotes only, because the widget's question is where to buy. But 36 of
 * the 122 commodities have no buy quote at all - they are things you sell - and returning nothing
 * for those would rebuild the exact blank this flight is fixing. So `sellOnlyMatches()` names them
 * and the widget says what they are and where the ranking lives. A count of sell terminals is a
 * fact; "sell it here for the most" is a route calculation and belongs to Trade.
 *
 * -- MEASURED ON THE LIVE CACHE, 2026-08-22 --------------------------------------------------
 *
 *   122 commodities · 690 buy rows · 1,882 sell rows · 0 rows with neither.
 *   86 commodities have a buy quote; 113 have a sell quote; 36 are sell-ONLY.
 *   `asOf` is populated on 2,572 of 2,572 rows. Median age 5.7 days.
 *   `stockScu` is known on 680 of the 690 buy rows (98.6%).
 *
 * 🔑 STOCK IS THE ONE THING COMMODITIES HAVE THAT ITEMS DO NOT. `item-shops.ts` says at length that
 * there is no stock field for items at any endpoint, and the widget tells the player so. Here there
 * IS one, on 98.6% of buy rows, and hiding it to keep the two row types looking identical would be
 * throwing away the most decision-shaped number on the screen: a price you cannot buy any of is not
 * a price. So a commodity row carries it and an item row does not, and that difference is real.

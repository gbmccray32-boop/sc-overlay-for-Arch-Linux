/**
 * TRADE - READING A REAL PURCHASE OUT OF `game.log`.
 *
 * Captured 2026-08-19 from Sub's own session: he stood at the Area 18 TDD and bought the SAME
 * commodity twice, once straight onto the ship and once to the freight elevator, specifically so
 * both shapes would be on record. Then the game crashed, which turned out to be the most useful
 * part of the experiment - see the blind spot at the bottom.
 *
 * -- The line, verbatim ---------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *   <2026-08-19T17:43:31.000Z> [Notice] <CEntityComponentCommodityUIProvider::SendCommodityBuyRequest>
 *   Sending SShopCommodityBuyRequest - playerId[204772220757] shopId[762985455925]
 *   shopName[TDD_SCShop-001] kioskId[762985455920] price[1202.000000]
 *   shopPricePerCentiSCU[12.019500] resourceGUID[accacd33-3a1a-4ec7-8b4a-14b9f028047c]
 *   autoLoading[1] quantity[100.000000 cSCU] Cargo Box Data: boxSize[1.000000] | unitAmount[1]
 *   [Team_CoreGameplayFeatures][Shops][UI]
 *
 * 🔑 `autoLoading` IS THE FLAG, AND IT WAS PROVEN RATHER THAN INFERRED. The two buys above are 16
 * seconds apart, identical in every field except this one: `1` on the purchase that went straight
 * into the hold, `0` on the one that went to the freight elevator. That is not a reading of the
 * field name, it is Sub buying it both ways on purpose so the difference had exactly one place to
 * show up. It matters because an `autoLoading[0]` purchase is cargo the player still has to go and
 * collect - the Stow tab's problem - while `autoLoading[1]` is already aboard.
 *
 * 🔑 `resourceGUID` JOINS STRAIGHT TO `data/commodities.json`, WHICH IS KEYED BY THE SAME UUID.
 * `accacd33-...` is Processed Food; `60f116f4-...` is Tungsten. No name matching, no normalising,
 * no dialect problem - the one clean join in this whole subsystem. Do NOT switch it for a name.
 *
 * 🔑 UNITS. `quantity` is in **cSCU** (centiSCU): 100 cSCU = 1 SCU. `shopPricePerCentiSCU` x 100
 * is the aUEC/SCU price. `price` is the total for the transaction. On both captured buys the
 * derived per-SCU figure matched the bundled snapshot's `bestBuy` for that terminal EXACTLY
 * (1202 for Processed Food, 8265 for Tungsten) a full month after the snapshot was taken -
 * which is real evidence that BUY prices are shop-set and barely drift, unlike sell prices.
 *
 * -- 🔴 THE BLIND SPOT, AND WHY THE CRASH WAS THE USEFUL PART ---------------------------------
 *
 * After Sub's game crashed and he logged back in, the new `Game.log` contained **zero**
 * `CommodityUI` lines. The purchase is NOT restated on reconnect - it exists only in the moment it
 * happened, in whichever log file was open at the time.
 *
 * 🔑 BUT THAT IS RECOVERABLE, AND AN EARLIER DRAFT OF THIS COMMENT OVERSTATED IT. The sidecar
 * already runs `seedFromRotatedLog()` at startup, which replays the newest file in `logbackups/`
 * when it is within `BACKUP_SEED_MAX_AGE_MS` - written for exactly this class of loss, after the
 * same crash pattern ate Sub's mission state on 2026-08-17. Sub's own purchase IS in that file and
 * the seed did replay it this session. So the honest statement is narrower:
 *
 *   - A purchase in the CURRENT log, or in the most recent and still-recent rotated one, is
 *     recoverable. That covers the crash case, which is the common one.
 *   - A purchase older than that window, or from before the app was installed, is not.
 *
 * ⚠️ NEITHER PATH IS WIRED YET. `seedFromRotatedLog()`'s loop calls `parseMissionEvent` only, and
 * the live watcher likewise. This parser needs a call in both - the same one-line shape the Log
 * View widget's second `watcher.on("line")` listener uses. Deliberately left for the tower to land
 * rather than spent from this flight's budget for edits to `overlay-server.ts`, which is being
 * restructured concurrently. See the flight strip's landing notes.
 *
 * Whatever is wired, the rule stands: what was never seen is reported as UNKNOWN. The widget must
 * never present an inferred hold as a known one. "I did not see you buy anything" is a true and
 * useful answer; a confidently empty cargo list is neither.
 *
 * -- ✅ THE SELL, CAPTURED 2026-08-19 - AND IT IS NOT THE BUY LINE MIRRORED -------------------
 *
 *   <...> <CEntityComponentCommodityUIProvider::SendCommoditySellRequest>
 *   Sending SShopCommoditySellRequest - playerId[...] shopId[762986059617]
 *   shopName[SCShop_Admin_lt_base_g] kioskId[762986059616] amount[1506.000000]
 *   resourceGUID[accacd33-3a1a-4ec7-8b4a-14b9f028047c] autoLoading[1] quantity[1]
 *   transactionMode[ResourceContainer] Cargo Box Data:  [boxSize[1] | unitAmount[1]]
 *
 * The verb name was the obvious guess and the obvious guess was right. THREE OTHER THINGS WERE
 * NOT, and every one of them would have shipped a wrong number:
 *
 * 🔴 1. `quantity` CHANGES UNIT BETWEEN THE TWO LINES. A buy says `quantity[100.000000 cSCU]`
 *       (centiSCU, so 1 SCU). A sell says `quantity[1]` with NO unit, meaning one CONTAINER, and
 *       flags it with the new `transactionMode[ResourceContainer]`. Dividing by 100 regardless -
 *       which is what the buy-only parser did - reports a 1 SCU sale as **0.01 SCU**, a 100x
 *       error in every figure downstream. So the unit is read off the FIELD TEXT, not assumed.
 * 🔴 2. The total is `amount[...]`, not `price[...]`. Same meaning, different key.
 * 🔴 3. There is NO `shopPricePerCentiSCU` on a sell, so the per-SCU figure has to be derived
 *       from total / SCU rather than read.
 *
 * 🔑 The captured round trip validates the whole chain: bought at 1,202/SCU, sold at 1,506/SCU,
 * same `resourceGUID` both ends (Processed Food), against a bundled snapshot that predicted 1,500
 * at that destination.
 *
 * ⚠️ Two further methods are on record and deliberately NOT modelled yet, because nothing is known
 * about what they should do: `LoadSelectedShipBindings` (a `VehicleCargoDataRequest` naming a
 * `vehicleEntityId` - plausibly the route to reading the real hold) and `AddPlayerCommodityItem`
 * with an empty `commodityName[]`, which describes a box the PLAYER brought. They surface through
 * `unknownMethod`/`offer` rather than being dropped.
 *
 * -- 🔴 A SELL DOES NOT STATE A VOLUME, AND THE APP PUBLISHED ONE ANYWAY ----------------------
 *
 * Measured 2026-08-24 (flight `sellvolume`) over the shared-log corpus, re-derived from the raw
 * rows rather than from the earlier flight's intermediate file, and deduplicated on contributor +
 * the game's own millisecond timestamp because the corpus re-uploads a growing live log:
 *
 *   204 confirmed commodity SELLS   |   45 BUYS
 *   110 of the 204 sells (53.9%) carry an EMPTY `Cargo Box Data:` - the phrase with nothing after
 *   it but the `[Team_...]` tags. 45 of 45 BUYS carry a manifest. The defect is sell-only.
 *
 * 🔑 **WHAT THE EMPTY-MANIFEST SELLS ARE.** Ranked by count: Dolivine, Hadanite, Beradom,
 * Glacosite, Sadaryx, Feynmaline, Aphorite, Beryl, Aslarite, Corundum - hand-mined gems, carried
 * in PERSONAL INVENTORY and sold at a TDD commodity exchange. There is no box data because there
 * are no boxes. **SCU is not an unknown unit for these, it is the wrong one.** A price-per-SCU for
 * Hadanite is not an uncertain number; it is a meaningless one, and the app's assumption that
 * everything sold is cargo is what was actually wrong.
 *
 * 🔑 **CORROBORATED ON A SECOND, INDEPENDENT CORPUS** - Sub's own 533 `logbackups/` on this
 * machine, which shares no rows with the shared-log table: **35 of 60 sells (58.3%) empty**,
 * **16 of 16 buys boxed**. The empty ones are Feynmaline, Compboard, Hadanite, Dolivine,
 * Glacosite, Aphorite, Janalite - and here the split is perfectly clean, with NO commodity
 * appearing on both sides. `npm run probe:sellunit` re-runs both.
 *
 * ⚠️ **BUT IT IS NOT ONLY GEMS, so do not gate on a commodity list.** 10 commodities appear on
 * BOTH sides - Tungsten, Iron, Aluminum, Gold, Laranite, Copper, Torite, Borase, Hephaestanite and
 * Recycled Material Composite all have empty-manifest sells too (17 of them). Ordinary cargo can
 * reach a terminal without a manifest. The MANIFEST is the test, never the commodity.
 *
 * 🔑 **THE DISCRIMINATOR THAT PROVES THEY ARE PARTIAL, NOT NOISE.** Against the boxed reading for
 * the same commodity at the same terminal, an empty-manifest sell prices at min 0.008x, median
 * 0.264x, **max 1.000x**. The CEILING is the evidence: if the game merely omitted the field at
 * random the two sets would overlap in both directions. They never exceed it, because `quantity`
 * has been rounded UP to a whole container the goods do not fill.
 *
 * 🔴 **AND THE RESIDUAL, WHICH IS NOT FIXED HERE AND MUST NOT BE FORGOTTEN: A BOXED SELL'S VOLUME
 * IS A CEILING TOO.** 16 groups of sells declare BYTE-IDENTICAL volumes at the same terminal for
 * the same commodity (same `quantity`, `boxSize`, `unitAmount`); **6 of the 16 disagree on the
 * total, the worst by 11.56x** (`q1 b1 u1` at Levski: 946 aUEC against 10,933). The cleanest
 * example is Lindinium at TDD Orison, four sells inside 20 seconds:
 *
 *     quantity[4] boxSize[4] unitAmount[1]  amount[202927]   -> 50,732/SCU   (UEX says ~51,000)
 *     quantity[1] boxSize[1] unitAmount[1]  amount[ 47249]   -> 47,249/SCU   (~0.93 SCU)
 *     quantity[1] boxSize[1] unitAmount[1]  amount[ 31380]   -> 31,380/SCU   (~0.62 SCU)
 *
 * Two identical declarations, 7 s apart, 1.5x apart in price. So `quantity` is the CEILING of the
 * real volume in every case and the manifest only tells you a container exists, not that it is
 * full. Across boxed sells in multi-sample groups, 24 of 69 sit below their group's best reading.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THIS FLIGHT DELIBERATELY DID NOT ACT ON THAT.** Sub's ruling was about a sell with no
 * volume, and marking EVERY sell unknown would empty his Ledger of closed runs - the feature he
 * has said he needs to trust before trading again. The bounded-by-one-container error a boxed sell
 * carries is a precision problem; the empty-manifest one is a 125x category error. If this is ever
 * revisited, the honest framing is already available: `total / quantity` is a LOWER BOUND on the
 * price, which this app already knows how to render (the reputation floors).
 *
 * 🔑 **`total` IS TRUE IN EVERY CASE.** The player was paid that many aUEC at that terminal at that
 * moment. That is what lets an unknown-volume sale be recorded rather than dropped - see
 * `TradeJournal.apply`, which books it as revenue with no SCU and no per-SCU figure.
 *
 * -- 🔴 A REQUEST IS NOT A TRANSACTION, AND THAT SHIPPED AS INVENTED PROFIT ---------------------
 *
 * Everything above parses a `Send...Request`. The name is the whole warning and nobody read it: a
 * REQUEST is what the client asked for, and the server is free to refuse. A refused request is
 * still in the log, byte-identical to one that worked.
 *
 * Sub hit it on 2026-08-23. He sold Compboard at Levski, the terminal showed an error, he retried,
 * it errored again, and the Ledger showed two completed sales:
 *
 *   19:57:48.914  SendCommoditySellRequest  amount[242550] quantity[1]
 *   19:57:49.250  [Error] RmToken_CommodityTransactionResponse
 *                 result[TransactionCostMismatch] type[Selling]        <- 336 ms later
 *   19:58:45.444  SendCommoditySellRequest  amount[242550] quantity[1] <- his retry
 *   19:58:45.702  [Error] ... same refusal                             <- 258 ms later
 *
 * **+428,872 aUEC of profit that never existed.** A third attempt at 20:02:41 refused too, so the
 * "genuine sale minutes later" in the first write-up of this bug was itself a failure - see the
 * correction under the census below.
 *
 * -- THE CENSUS THAT DECIDES THE RULE (533 files, 1.47 GB, every rotated log on Sub's disk) -----
 *
 *   65 `Send...Request` lines   |   39 `RmToken_CommodityTransactionResponse` lines
 *
 * 🔑 **EVERY ONE OF THE 39 IS AN `[Error]`. A SUCCESS EMITS NOTHING AT ALL.** So the rule is
 * "commit unless a refusal arrives", NEVER "commit when a success arrives" - the second would
 * throw away all 26 successful trades in the corpus. This was worth re-measuring rather than
 * taking from one day's log: one session could have been a quiet build.
 *
 * 🔑 **THE PAIRING IS A BIJECTION.** Every response has a send before it (0 orphans) and no
 * response was the nearest-following one for two different sends. Nothing has to be guessed about
 * which request a refusal belongs to in any session on record.
 *
 * 🔑 **THE TWO NUMBERS THAT SIZE THE WINDOW, and they are far enough apart to make the choice
 * uncontroversial:**
 *   - a refusal lands **158 ms min / 243 ms median / 565 ms MAX** after its request;
 *   - the closest two requests ever get, in any session, is **3,655 ms**.
 * `CONFIRM_WINDOW_MS` = 2,000 sits between them: 3.5x the slowest refusal on record, and a little
 * over half the tightest request spacing. Too short re-books the phantom sales; too long lets a
 * refusal claim an EARLIER request that really did succeed.
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE REFUSAL NAMES NO COMMODITY AND NO AMOUNT** - only `playerId`, `result` and
 * `type[Selling|Buying]`. So the match is by proximity and direction, and it can never be by
 * `resourceGUID`. Three `result` values are on record: `TransactionCostMismatch` (2026-08-23),
 * `EntityQueryFailed` (x24) and `WaitingForPendingResult` (x12). They are recorded, never
 * interpreted - the app has no business deciding which refusals are "real" ones.
 *
 * ⚠️ **ALL 39 ARE `type[Selling]`.** Not one refused BUY is on record - and that is a fact about
 * Sub's 13 buys, not about the game, since the field exists and names a direction. The direction is
 * matched both ways; nothing here assumes selling.
 *
 * ⚠️ **The corroborating positive signal is DELIBERATELY UNUSED.** A successful sale is followed by
 * a shop-inventory reload (`AddingCommodityBox`) because the shop's stock changed - but that same
 * reload fires whenever a kiosk is opened, so building on it would confirm a refused sale for any
 * player who re-opened the terminal to try again. Which is exactly what Sub did, three times.
 *
 * 🔑 **A held request costs LATENCY, and the number is measured rather than hoped for.** Feeding
 * every send in the corpus through a 2,000 ms window, the next log line able to release it arrives
 * a median 5.6 s later, p90 20 s, worst 54 s (and 0 of 65 reached end-of-file still held). Half a
 * minute of a trade not being listed is the price of never listing one that did not happen.

/**
 * 🔴 THE ONLY THING ALLOWED TO SAY A TRANSACTION HAPPENED.
 *
 * `parseTradeLine` reads a REQUEST. This holds it, watches for the refusal that would kill it, and
 * releases it once the window has passed in silence. The full reasoning and the census that sized
 * the window are in the file header; the rules the code has to keep are:
 *
 * 🔑 **COMMIT UNLESS REFUSED, never commit-when-confirmed.** A success emits no line at all, so
 * waiting for one discards every successful trade in the corpus.
 *
 * 🔑 **THE CLOCK IS THE LOG'S, NEVER THE WALL'S.** A held request is released by the arrival of a
 * LINE whose timestamp is past the window, and by `flush()` at end of stream. A `setTimeout` would
 * behave one way while tailing and another while replaying a rotated log, and the difference would
 * only ever show up as a wrong number in somebody's journal weeks later. Feed EVERY line, not only
 * the commodity ones - the non-commodity ones are what move the clock while tailing.
 *
 * 🔑 **ONLY ONE REQUEST IS EVER RESIDENT, AND THE REASON IS NOT THE ONE YOU REACH FOR.** The tower
 * asked what happens when a refusal lands with a queue behind it — a fair question, because the
 * census measured request SPACING and spacing is not residency. The answer is that a REQUEST line
 * is itself a stamped line, so it advances the clock and releases the request before it. With the
 * tightest pair of requests 3,655 ms apart against a 2,000 ms window, the previous one is always
 * already gone. **Both measured numbers are load-bearing**: raise the window past the spacing and
 * several really do pile up.
 *
 * 🔑 **THE NEWEST MATCH IS A TIE-BREAK FOR A REGIME THE SHIPPED WINDOW NEVER ENTERS, not the thing
 * keeping this correct.** Worth stating plainly because it was got wrong once, in this very file: a
 * source control flipping the iteration in refuse() to oldest-first comes back GREEN at the shipped
 * window, because the window filter alone already excludes every older request. The ordering only
 * becomes observable — and the control only reddens — once the window is widened past the request
 * spacing, which is exactly how the suite exercises it.
 *
 * ⚠️ Instances are cheap and hold at most a handful of entries. Use ONE for the live stream so the
 * seed and the watcher hand over inside the same window, and a FRESH one per file for a bulk
 * replay of complete rotated logs, flushing at the end of each.

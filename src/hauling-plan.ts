/**
 * HAULING PLAN — the join that turns live contract state into something a widget can draw.
 *
 * Three landed pieces have to meet here and nowhere else:
 *   `HaulingTracker`  what the LOG knows (contracts, legs, positions, progress, ship)
 *   `HaulingDataStore` what the DATACORE knows (ship grids, per-contract SCU bounds + box caps)
 *   the solver         `partitionScu` -> `packCargo` -> `planRun`, all pure and set-agnostic
 *
 * ── 🔴 THE RULE THIS MODULE EXISTS TO ENFORCE ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * **The dataset BOUNDS a contract's load. It does not tell you it.** Measured across all 4,769
 * orders in the shipped `hauling-orders.json`: 2,062 have `minScu == maxScu` and **2,707 (57%)
 * have `minScu < maxScu`**. Sub's own 2026-08-16 contract reads `maxContainerSize: 4, minScu: 7,
 * maxScu: 16` — a 9 SCU spread on a 16 SCU haul.
 *
 * The ONE thing that pins the real number is the log's `New Objective: Deliver 0/N SCU …` line,
 * and that line is **TRACKING-GATED** — the game emits it only for a contract the player has
 * TRACKED in mobiGlas. So tracking is not a nicety, it is the primary source of truth for most
 * contracts, and `ScuSource` below is the whole point of this file: every number the widget draws
 * carries where it came from, and a range never collapses into a fake exact figure.
 *
 * ── ⚠️ AND THE SOLVER GETS THE REAL BOX TABLE ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `cargo-boxes.ts` was written before the box set was settled, so its DEFAULT_BOX_SET still flags
 * 24 and 32 as "contested" and hardcodes x-major footprints. Both were answered by the shipped
 * data: `hauling-orders.json` carries the canonical `boxes` table (1·2·4·8·16·24·32, y-major),
 * and `maxContainerSize` is **per contract** — 24 appears ONLY in `Hauling - Interstellar`, while
 * `Hauling - Planetary` uses 1, 4, 8, 16, 32. So the set comes off the dataset and the cap comes
 * off the contract; nothing here hardcodes a size.

   * XYZ — would silently stop resolving there. Today a marker key happens to sort before `buy:`

     cargo, and had to dig for the right one. "So it told me to do it backwards."

     Two rules, and the physical one wins:
       1. COLLECTION. You load through the door, so whatever you collect LAST necessarily sits
          nearest it. Cargo picked up later cannot be buried under cargo picked up earlier — hence
          pickup order DESCENDING. Cargo already aboard was collected before everything, so it is
          deepest of all.
       2. DELIVERY. Within one collection stop the choice is free, so the load dropped FIRST goes
          nearest the door — drop order ASCENDING.

     Sub's board: both collected at the same stop, so rule 2 decides, and Silicon (dropped at Riker,
     first) belongs at the ramp with Scrap (Wala, second) behind it. */

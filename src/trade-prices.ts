/**
 * TRADE - THE PRICE TABLE, AND WHERE EVERY NUMBER IN IT CAME FROM.
 *
 * Phase 2 of hauling is commodity trading: buy cheap at one terminal, haul it, sell dear at
 * another. That needs per-terminal buy and sell prices, and this module is the only place that
 * decides where they come from.
 *
 * 🔴 THE STANDING CONSTRAINT: THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS "THE PRICE OF TITANIUM". Prices are
 * per-terminal and they move. Every quote here therefore carries its OWN `asOf`, and nothing
 * downstream may collapse a set of quotes into one number without also carrying the spread. A UI
 * that implies false precision here is worse than no UI (Sub, repeatedly).
 *
 * -- The source chain: live -> cache -> bundled, and it always SAYS which --------------------
 *
 * `source` is on every table this module hands out, because Sub's requirement was explicit: the
 * user needs to know when they are looking at the fallback. Silence is the failure mode.
 *
 *   "live"    a refresh landed this session. Rows carry real `asOf` timestamps.
 *   "cache"   a previous session's refresh, replayed off disk. Still real timestamps, older.
 *   "bundled" data/commodities.json, which ships in the build. Works with no network at all, and
 *             carries NO per-quote timestamps and almost no stock - see the honesty notes below.
 *
 * 🔴 THE API KEY MUST NEVER SHIP IN THIS APP. It is a distributable desktop binary: a key inside
 * it is extractable, and then strangers spend our quota. So the app fetches an UNAUTHENTICATED
 * endpoint on subliminal.gg, which holds one key server-side and polls UEX on everyone's behalf -
 * the same shape `/api/sc/mission-payout` and `/api/sc/mission-feedback` already use. The URL is
 * config so that moving the poller is a settings change rather than a rewrite.
 *
 * -- What live buys us, measured 2026-08-19 against the real API -----------------------------
 *
 * `GET /2.0/commodities_prices_all` is 2,593 rows / 1.07 MB in ONE call, 0.69s. Against the
 * bundled snapshot it wins on exactly three things, and it is worth being precise about which:
 *
 *   - STOCK. 701 of 711 live buy rows carry `scu_buy`. In the bundle, stock is known for 13% of
 *     routes. This is the real prize - a margin you cannot buy any of is not a trade.
 *   - DEMAND. `scu_sell` / `scu_sell_stock`. The bundled row shape has no demand field at all.
 *   - AGE. `date_modified` per row. The bundle has no timestamps anywhere.
 *
 * It does NOT buy more commodities: 87 buyable live vs 90 bundled, 135 terminals vs 133.
 *
 * 🔑 AND IT IS NOT "LIVE PRICES", WHICH IS WHY `asOf` IS MANDATORY RATHER THAN DECORATION.
 * UEX is crowd-sourced and says so. Measured over all 2,593 rows: median age 2.6 DAYS, p25 0.8d,
 * 753 rows under 24h, p90 10.2d, max 523d. So polling every few minutes keeps OUR copy minutes
 * behind UEX while UEX sits a median 2.6 days behind the verse. The number that actually tells a
 * player whether to trust a quote is the row's own age, not the refresh interval - so we render
 * the row's age and never advertise the interval.
 *
 * 🔑 `price_buy` IS THE CURRENT REPORTED PRICE. The averaging visible in UEX's docs lives in
 * SEPARATE columns (`price_buy_avg`, `_week`, `_month`); it is not folded into the plain field.
 * An earlier reading of the docs concluded the opposite and it was wrong.
 *
 * ⚠️ `is_available_live` IS 1 ON ONLY 114 OF 135 PRICED TERMINALS. Twenty-one terminals carry
 * prices in the data and do not exist in the running game. Routing a player to one is a wasted
 * trip that looks exactly like the app being wrong, so they are dropped - and counted, because a
 * silent filter is how a data problem becomes invisible.

 * `scu_sell_stock` is populated on 1,550 of them. A sample row makes it unambiguous - TDD Area 18
 * buying Aluminum reads `scu_sell: 0` beside `scu_sell_stock: 1034` and `scu_sell_avg: 4357`. A

 * The bug this fixes: `num(scu_sell) ?? num(scu_sell_stock)` never fell through, because `??`
 * passes on null and NOT on 0. Every one of those 1,628 rows therefore arrived with
 * `demandScu: 0`, the finder capped the run at 0 SCU and dropped it - so four fifths of all sell
 * terminals silently removed their own routes. It surfaced only because the lookup view printed
 * "0 SCU wanted" against every terminal and that read as obviously false.
 *
 * ⚠️ So `TradeQuote`'s contract is unchanged and still says `0` means a known zero - it is the

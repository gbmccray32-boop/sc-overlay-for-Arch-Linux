 *
 *   "We don't need to know the distance between one system and another because you have to jump
 *    through the wormhole. We already have the data on how long that takes. So we just know how
 *    long it takes to get from one planet to the Nyx Gateway, and then from the Stanton Gateway on
 *    the other side, we measure the distance from that to whatever in Nyx."
 *
 * Three parts: origin -> outbound gateway (in-system), the jump (a fixed cost), inbound gateway ->
 * destination (in-system). Per-system coordinate frames are fine for this, and are the reason the
 * decomposition is the right shape: you never compare a Stanton coordinate to a Pyro one.

 * **4,790 minutes** for Crusader -> microTech, a leg that really takes about four. It never
 * misbehaved only because it was never exercised: `locations.json`'s `markerXyz` table ships
 * EMPTY (0 entries — see the comments at `hauling-plan.ts:685` and `:954`), so `posOf` returned
 * null everywhere and the router always fell back to the region constants above. Wiring
 * `locations-xyz` in is exactly what wakes the dead term up, so it had to be fixed first.
 *
 * Measured 2026-08-21, and it is worth stating the corroboration because a single reading of a
 * flown leg is weak evidence:
 *   distance Crusader -> microTech   57.48 Gm   (locations-xyz)   vs 59.46 Gm recorded independently
 *                                                                    in hauling-route's own comment

 *   => implied speed                 2.34e8 m/s
 * Two sources agreeing within 3% on the distance and 2% on the time is what makes this a
 * correction rather than a guess.
 *
 * 🔑 The extraction: the `[QuantumTravel]` channel emits `<Player Selected Quantum Target>` then

/**
 * 🔴 SUB IS RIGHT THAT THIS DEPENDS ON THE EQUIPPED QUANTUM DRIVE — AND THE LOG CANNOT GIVE US ONE.
 *
 * His objection, 2026-08-22: "those quantum drive numbers are going to be dependent on what quantum
 * drive I actually have equipped on my ship." Correct, and it is worth writing down exactly how far
 * the data can and cannot go, so nobody re-runs this hoping for a per-drive constant.
 *
 * Measured over the 250 long legs (>5 Gm, where speed dominates rather than spool) that name a hull:
 *
 *   36 distinct hulls. Medians span 7.5x — Gladius Valiant 9.6e8 down to Cutlass Red 1.3e8, and the
 *   ordering is plausible (light fighters fast, haulers slow), so the effect is real.
 *
 * 🔴 BUT THE WITHIN-HULL SPREAD IS 144x. The SAME ship on different legs varies far more than ships
 * vary from each other, so the drive's signal is buried. The bracket is `Player Selected Quantum
 * Target` -> `Quantum Drive Arrived`, and that window contains the player deciding, re-selecting,
 * and getting around to actually engaging. Fitting a per-hull speed off it would be fitting how
 * long Sub took to press the button.
 *
 * 🔴 AND A HULL IS NOT A DRIVE ANYWAY. The quantum drive is a COMPONENT — two Guardians can carry
 * different ones — and the log names the ship entity, never the loadout. So even a clean per-hull
 * fit would not be the number he is asking about. Getting it properly needs the equipped item,
 * which nothing we read reports.
 *
 * 🔑 WHY THIS DOES NOT CHANGE THE VERSE FINDER, which is the practical point: within one system
 * `minutes = d / v`, so a different drive scales EVERY row by the same factor and the ordering is
 * untouched. It only shifts the balance between in-system distance and the fixed `JUMP_MINUTES`,
 * i.e. it can only re-order a far in-system shop against a near cross-system one. And the figure
 * the player is SHOWN is the distance, which no drive affects. That is the strongest argument for
 * the show-distance/order-by-minutes split: the drive-dependent half never reaches the screen.
 */

/**
 * ⚠️ BELOW THIS RANGE THE DRIVE WILL NOT SPOOL — MEASURED 2026-08-22, replacing a recollection.
 *
 * This read `20_000_000` (20,000 km) and carried an honest label saying it was Sub's recollection
 * rather than a measurement — "I want to say it's like 20,000 kilometers", flagged the same way the
 * jump cost is. It has now been measured, and it was too high by roughly seventyfold.
 *
 * The extraction is the one `references/travel.md` already documents — `<Player Selected Quantum
 * Target>` then `<Quantum Drive Arrived - Arrived at Final Destination>`, with `Calculate Route`
 * naming the destination in between — run over 529 of Sub's logs and keeping only the legs where
 * BOTH ends resolve to a placed starmap id in the SAME system, so a real distance can be computed:
 *
 *   309 completed legs with both ends placed; 33 of them shorter than the old floor.
 *   shortest completed leg    283 km   Wala to ArcCorp Mining Area 056   (0.54 and 0.64 min)
 *   the shape Sub hit         801 km   ArcCorp to Area18                 (0.35 / 0.62 / 0.77 min)
 *
 * 🔑 THE JOIN THAT MADE IT MEASURABLE, and it is worth knowing for any future log work:
 * `locations-xyz` carries an `entity` token per place (1,144 of 1,189) and that token is EXACTLY
 * what the log names as a destination. `rs_ext_cru-leo1` is Seraphim Station. No fuzzy name
 * matching, no guessing — a direct join from a log line to a coordinate.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS IS AN UPPER BOUND, NOT THE FLOOR ITSELF. 283 km is the shortest hop we have WATCHED the
 * drive make; the true refusal point is at or below it. That is the honest reading and it is the
 * direction that matters — the old value claimed the drive refuses hops it demonstrably makes.

  // exactly as written — the terminal join, the units and the coordinates were all correct, which
  // is why looking for a broken join found nothing.
  //
  // 🔑 THE PROPERTY THAT HAS TO HOLD, and the reason a second speed cannot come back: WITHIN ONE
  // SYSTEM, A NEARER PLACE MUST NEVER QUOTE MORE MINUTES THAN A FARTHER ONE. Two speeds with a
  // discontinuity between them cannot satisfy that at ANY floor value — lowering the floor MOVES
  // the inversion, it does not remove it — which is why correcting the floor above was necessary
  // and not sufficient. One speed makes the property true by construction, and the sweep in
  // `verse-proximity.test.ts` walks every Stanton shop in ascending distance to hold it there.
  //
  // ⚠️ WHAT IS GIVEN UP, stated rather than hidden: a sub-quantum hop is now quoted
  // OPTIMISTICALLY, because `QUANTUM_SPEED_MPS` is an effective speed carrying no fixed spool term
  // (see its comment), so every short hop lands near zero. Measured, an 800 km hop really takes
  // about 0.6 min. That is a real limitation at short range — and it is one the model ALREADY had
  // on the quantum side of the old floor. All this does is stop the two sides disagreeing. It is
  // tolerable in the Verse Finder because the number's job there is to ORDER shops, and what the
  // player is shown is the DISTANCE, which is exact.
  //
  // 🔑 The fix for the short-range optimism is a two-parameter fit (spool + speed) across legs of
  // differing length, NOT another speed with a cliff in it. The data to do it now exists — the 309
  // measured legs above — and a first pass gives `1.46 min + d / 5.03e8 m/s`. That reproduces
  // Crusader to microTech at 3.36 min against the 4.09 recorded two other ways, and an 18% gap on
  // the one leg two independent sources agree about is why it is written down here rather than
  // shipped. The ordering bug does not need it.
  const speed = QUANTUM_SPEED_MPS;
  // 🔴 NO OVERHEAD IS ADDED ON THE QUANTUM PATH, and that is not an omission.
  //
  // `QUANTUM_SPEED_MPS` was derived as distance / TOTAL measured time — and the measured time is
  // target-selected to arrived, so it already contains spool, align and drop-out. Adding the ~3
  // minutes `hauling-route`'s comment attributes to those charges them twice: the first version of
  // this function did exactly that and put Crusader -> microTech at 7.09 min against the ~4.1 that
  // two independent sources record. The test caught it, which is the whole reason it reproduces a
  // real leg rather than asserting the arithmetic back at itself.
  //
  // ⚠️ THE CONSEQUENCE, stated rather than hidden: this is an EFFECTIVE speed, exact at the range
  // it was measured (57 Gm) and optimistic for short quantum hops, where a fixed spool cost is a
  // larger share of the trip. Separating the two needs a fit across legs of differing length —
  // one measurement is one equation in two unknowns, and the events work already paid for guessing
  // at that. There are 309 such measurements now, and the fit they give is recorded above.
  //
  // ⚠️ There used to be a `+1` minute here on the sub-quantum path only. It was the second half of
  // the same inversion — a fixed penalty applied to exactly the shops nearest the player — and it
  // is gone with the second speed. A term that applies to one side of a threshold and not the
  // other is a discontinuity however small it is.

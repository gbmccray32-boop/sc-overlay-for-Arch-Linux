/**
 * THE ONE PLACE A LOG LINE BECOMES AN OBSERVED PRICE.
 *
 * The sidecar reads `game.log` in three places — the rotated-log seed, the live-log seed, and the
 * watcher — and every one of them already called `tradeLogLine()`. This file wraps that single
 * call so all three gain item-shop capture by changing ONE WORD each, instead of growing three
 * copies of a fan-out that would then have to be kept in step.
 *
 * 🔑 THAT IS THE POINT, NOT TIDINESS. This project has been bitten repeatedly by a rule enforced
 * in some of its call sites and not others — `seedFromRotatedLog()` was missing the environment
 * gate for months, and every receipt in a replayed PTU backup counted as live. A fan-out that
 * lives in one function cannot be half-applied.
 *
 * ── WHAT FLOWS THROUGH HERE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   items        `item-shop-log.ts`  ->  confirmed on an explicit `result[Success]`
 *   commodities  `trade-log.ts`      ->  confirmed by the ABSENCE of a refusal
 *
 * 🔴 THE TWO CONFIRMATION RULES ARE OPPOSITE AND MUST STAY THAT WAY. Item shops answer every
 * request, so silence there means nothing happened; commodity terminals answer only to refuse, so
 * silence there means it went through. Each subsystem owns its own gate and this file never
 * second-guesses either — it takes `confirmed` as given and passes it to a store that drops
 * anything which is not exactly `true`.
 *
 * ⚠️ ONE gate instance for the whole live stream, deliberately not reset between the seed and the
 * watcher: they read contiguous bytes of the same file, so a purchase whose Success is in the
 * watcher's first bytes must still find its request. The commodity side keeps the identical rule
 * for the identical reason.

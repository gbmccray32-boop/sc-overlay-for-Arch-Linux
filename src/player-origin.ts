/**
 * WHERE IS THE PLAYER — and how much should anyone believe it.
 *
 * 🔴 EVERY DISTANCE THIS APP SHOWS RESTS ON THIS, and it is an inference. Trade routes, hauling
 * routes and the Verse Finder all order things by "how far from you", and each is only as
 * trustworthy as the guess underneath. Sub was explicit that the confidence has to travel with the
 * number: "we'll need to have that on any app that's going to be giving distance."
 *
 * -- What the log actually offers, measured on a real 16 MB session ---------------------------
 *
 * Sub's framing: "All we could do is find every point at which they can interact with something
 * that allows to pinpoint their location." That is the whole design — there is no position feed,
 * so this is an inventory of the moments the game happens to say where you are.
 *
 *   TIER          signal                                              fires
 *   place         `requested inventory for Location[X]`               when you open inventory (12)
 *   place         ASOP terminal / ship list provider                  when you retrieve a ship
 *   place         freight elevator platform                           when you move cargo (184)
 *   place         `Quantum Drive Arrived` + the route's destination   on every completed QT (4)
 *   body          `planet cells:` terrain report                      EVERY 10 MIN, near a planet
 *   system        `Projected Start Location is X`                     on every route calculation (21)
 *
 * 🔑 THE TERRAIN REPORT IS THE ONLY ONE THAT FIRES ON ITS OWN. Every other signal needs the player
 * to do something, so without it a session that is just flying goes dark indefinitely. That is
 * what makes it worth having despite being the coarsest: it is the only heartbeat.
 * ⚠️ It carries NO coordinates — measured, the payload has zero fractional numbers. It names the
 * body whose terrain is streaming (`OOC_Stanton_2b_Daymar`) and nothing more. Anything expecting a
 * position from it is expecting the wrong thing.
 *
 * -- Why this is not simply "freshest wins" ---------------------------------------------------
 *
 * 🔴 THE HEARTBEAT WOULD MASK EVERY PRECISE FIX. The terrain report fires every ten minutes
 * unconditionally, so on a planet-side outpost it is almost always the newest thing in the log —
 * and a naive freshest-wins would replace "you are at Shubin SAL-2" with "you are somewhere near
 * Lyria" within ten minutes of arriving, forever. Precision would decay on a timer while the
 * player stood still.
 *
 * So: **the most PRECISE signal wins while it is still plausible**, and a coarser one only takes
 * over when the precise one has aged out or is contradicted. A newer coarse reading that
 * CONTAINS the older precise one is not a contradiction — being near Lyria is exactly what being
 * at a Lyria outpost looks like — so it refreshes the fix rather than replacing it.
 *
 * -- 🔴 SHOP TERMINALS: REJECTED AS A COVERAGE TIER, BUILT FOR TWO OTHER REASONS ---------------
 *
 * ⚠️ READ THE WHOLE OF THIS SECTION BEFORE CHANGING ANYTHING ABOUT TERMINALS. The census below is
 * still correct and still binding; what changed on 2026-08-23 is that Sub asked two questions it
 * had never been asked, and the answers are different. The one mechanism proved to go permanently
 * wrong — a PERSISTED `shopName -> place` map — is still not built and must not be.
 *
 * **1. RESILIENCE.** Sub: *"At any time CIG can update the logs to remove information. If we can
 * get the player's location from multiple different sources, then if they change something in the
 * future we may not even need to change anything with our app."* Coverage was the wrong measure for
 * that question: a source worth nothing today is insurance tomorrow, but only if it is genuinely
 * INDEPENDENT. So `origin-signals.ts` reads the shop's OWN NAME against the starmap — 28 of 61
 * names resolve to exactly one row, 0 ambiguously — which survives every other signal being
 * removed. A binding learned from a location line does not, and is kept separate for that reason.
 *
 * **2. PRECISION.** Station-level is enough for a distance and not enough for *"meet me at the
 * cargo office at Levski"*. `shopName`/`kioskId` name a terminal INSIDE the station. That rides as
 * `OriginSignal.detail` and moves no tier — new capability, not a duplicate one.
 *
 * 🔴 AND THE ONE MEASURED WARNING THAT STILL STANDS: **no terminal binding is ever persisted.**
 * `SCShop_Cargo_Office` exists at 13 stations and a 300 s learning window already had 5 of 27
 * pairings wrong. `PlayerLocation.shopPlaces` is in-memory, per session, and has no save path.
 * ⚠️ One thing the census ASSERTED without measuring turns out to be false, and it is recorded here
 * so nobody builds on either version: `shopId` is NOT re-minted per session. Across 533 logs, 11
 * ids appear in more than one session and none ever names two places. Eleven is far too thin to
 * persist anything on, so the in-session-only rule stands on Sub's instruction and on the shopNAME
 * evidence — not on the re-minting claim, which was never measured.
 *
 * The original census, unchanged, because it is what makes all of the above judgeable:
 *
 * Sub asked whether the app can tell where a player is when they buy something at a terminal:
 * "now that I've been going to these terminals to buy things, I want you to see if we can
 * determine where a person is when they interact with these terminals." The proposal was a fourth
 * `place` source — learn `shopName -> place` where a shop line co-occurs with a location line,
 * persist it, and let later visits become an immediate fix, since `shopName` survives sessions
 * where the runtime `shopId` does not.
 *
 * 🔴 THE FIX IS REAL AND THE TIER IS WORTHLESS, AND THOSE ARE TWO DIFFERENT SENTENCES. A terminal
 * does place you, to the station, reliably. It buys nothing because **a terminal is inside a
 * station and you cannot get inside one without the app having already placed you** — docking,
 * spawning and walking in all fire an inventory, an ASOP or a freight lift first. Measured over
 * Sub's entire log history (533 logs, 74 sessions with shopping, 727 shop-terminal lines,
 * 382.6 h of wall-clock):
 *
 *   - **0 of 727** shop lines were the first thing to place him in that session. Not rare — never.
 *     A persisted map only ever pays at such a "cold open"; anywhere else it repeats a fix we hold.
 *   - Counting a shop line as a place signal moves freshness coverage **57.3% -> 57.4%**: a gain
 *     of **37 minutes across 382.6 hours**. Against the more generous baseline it is 11 minutes.
 *   - The window cannot be chosen safely. Pairing within 60 s learns **7** shop names and nothing
 *     wrong; within 300 s it learns 27 and **5 are already ambiguous**. There is no window where
 *     the map is both useful and safe.
 *
 * 🔑 AND THE AMBIGUITY IS WORSE THAN "SOME NAMES ARE GENERIC". `SCShop_AdminOffice_Nyx_Social
 * Station` — a name that carries a place token — sits at three different Keeger asteroid bases,
 * two of them in ONE session of Sub's. What such a name states is the SYSTEM and the station
 * CLASS, never the station. `shopId` really is site-unique (102 of 102 within a session) but it
 * is re-minted per session, so it can never be persisted. The stable identifier is ambiguous and
 * the unambiguous one is not stable, which is the whole reason this does not work.
 *
 * 🔑 Re-ask it after a patch with **`npm run measure:terminalorigin`**. It exits non-zero the
 * moment a cold open appears, which is exactly the observation that would reopen the design.
 * ⚠️ Do NOT read "the fix was fresh whenever he shopped" as the finding — that is true and beside
 * the point, since the widget is read at arbitrary moments. Coverage is the measure, and it moved
 * by a rounding error.

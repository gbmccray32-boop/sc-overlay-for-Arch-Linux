// 🔴 REPRODUCED FROM SUB'S LIVE PTU BOARD, 2026-08-19. Two "Orison Relief" priority contracts that
// both drop at August Dunlow Spaceport. Their drop markers sit ~1 km apart, and `posKey` rounds to
// the kilometre, so they keyed as `@5297,-873,5280` and `@5297,-872,5281` — two ids for one
// spaceport. The router built a stop for each and produced pickup → drop → pickup → drop, flying
// back and forth across the system for what is one landing.
//
// Both pickups are on microTech, and neither contract key carries a region token
// (`ORS_MA_HaulingSmall`), so `regionByLoc` was empty and every leg was charged the same flat
// cross-body rate — every ordering tied and the optimiser had no reason to group anything.

/**
 * VERSE FINDER - THE SIDECAR SURFACE, DELIBERATELY ALL IN ONE FILE.
 *
 * 🔴 `overlay-server.ts` IS THE BUSIEST FILE IN THE REPO and four separate efforts have edited it.
 * So this subsystem touches it in exactly ONE place: one import and one call. Every route, every
 * piece of state and every default lives here, and anything added to this feature later belongs
 * in this file too - the moment a second hook appears in the server, that promise is gone. Same
 * discipline as `trade-routes.ts`, for the same reason.
 *
 * Routes, all GET, all read-only:
 *
 *   /api/verse/status          where the table came from, how old it is, and what it cannot say
 *   /api/verse/search?q=       ranked items, each with every shop that sells it
 *
 * -- WHAT "ITEM" MEANS HERE, WIDENED 2026-08-22 ----------------------------------------------
 *
 * One box, three sources, and the merge is what makes it one feature rather than three:
 *
 *   SHOP ITEMS   the site's table. Unchanged.
 *   SHIPS        rows in that same table, because Sub ruled a ship is not different from any other
 *                item - "people just need to know where it is and know how much it costs". Nothing
 *                in this file knows a ship from a magazine; a rental quote is labelled and that is
 *                the only difference the whole path carries.
 *   COMMODITIES  BORROWED from the trade subsystem via `deps.commodities`, adapted by
 *                `verse-commodities.ts`. Never a second store - see that dep's note.
 *
 * 🔑 THEY ARE SCORED BY ONE SCORER AND MERGED INTO ONE RANKED LIST. A player typing a name does not
 * know which of our tables the answer lives in, so ranking by source would make the order depend on
 * our storage rather than on what they typed.
 *
 * 🔴 AND A BLANK RESULT NOW SAYS WHICH KIND OF BLANK IT IS. `unpriced` names catalogued items no
 * shop sells (two thirds of the catalogue) and `sellOnly` names commodities you can only sell (36
 * of 122). Both are computed ONLY when the search found nothing, because that is the one moment
 * they are an answer rather than noise.
 *
 * 🔑 EVERY RESPONSE CARRIES `source` AND THE TABLE'S AGE. Sub's requirement is that the user knows
 * when they are on a fallback, and a widget can only say so on the screen they are looking at.
 *
 * ⚠️ These are GETs and they are unauthenticated like the rest of the widget API, which is
 * LAN-reachable (OBS browser sources on another PC). Acceptable here because nothing in this file
 * spends a credential, writes anything, or reveals anything the player did not already publish -
 * it reads a public shop table. If a WRITE is ever added it needs the loopback gate `/api/twitch/*`
 * uses. See references/security.md.

 *
 * `poolfill` shipped community prices as a `SEEN IN GAME` block drawn above the shop list. The DATA
 * was right and the presentation was not. Sub, looking at it:
 *
 *   "The only thing that I wanted to change with the UI is simply instead of Cargo Services at
 *    Levski saying 25 days old, it would simply say four hours ago... Instead, it tells me 25 days
 *    ago 7 aUEC and also 7 aUEC four hours ago. It's just too much."
 *
 *   "The other locations that I'm showing, I don't know where those would be. It's useless
 *    information to the viewer."
 *
 *   "The ones that we can't merge with UEX because they use different names, just put those in
 *    line with everything else, but still have it sorted by distance."
 *
 * So there is ONE list now, ordered by proximity, and a confirmation reaches it one of three ways:
 *
 *   FOLD    the token is known to BE a terminal UEX prices. The confirmation lands ON that row —
 *           it is a fresher answer to the question that row already asks, not a second row.
 *   PLACE   the token cannot be tied to a terminal but CAN be tied to a station. It becomes a row
 *           of its own, positioned by that station and sorted with everything else. Sub's objection
 *           was that those shops "could be anywhere"; placed and sorted they are not.
 *   NEITHER counted and never named. See `unplacedConfirmations`.
 *
 * 🔑 THIS ALL HAPPENS INSIDE THE ORDERING HOOK, BEFORE THE CAP. Folding afterwards would order the
 * survey rows by distance and then staple confirmations on by some other rule, which is the two-
 * lists design wearing one list's clothes. `reserveTierRows` also has to see the placed rows or a

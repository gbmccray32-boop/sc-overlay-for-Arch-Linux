/**
 * VERSE FINDER - MATCHING WHAT A PLAYER TYPES TO WHAT UEX CALLS THE THING.
 *
 * Pure functions over the shop table, kept out of `item-shops.ts` (which owns provenance) and out
 * of the route file (which owns the wire) because this is the part with real behaviour to test.
 *
 * Three problems, all measured against the live catalogue on 2026-08-20, and each one is why a
 * particular rule below exists rather than the obvious simpler thing.
 *
 * 🔴 1. PUNCTUATION-STRIPPED SUBSTRING MATCHING FALSE-MATCHES ACROSS WORD BOUNDARIES.
 * The normaliser this codebase already uses elsewhere - `lower().replace(/[^a-z0-9]+/g,"")` - is
 * correct for JOINING two known names and actively wrong for free-text search, because it fuses
 * the whole name into one run. Searching `Atlas` then matches *Pulse "GreyCAT LASer" Pistol*:
 * "greycatlaserpistol" genuinely contains "atlas". So nothing here ever flattens a name to a
 * single string. Everything matches against TOKENS, and a substring may only ever be found
 * INSIDE one token, never straddling two.
 *
 * ⚠️ 2. ATTACHMENTS SWAMP EVERY WEAPON SEARCH. `P4-AR` returns *P4-AR Magazine (40 Cap)* before
 * the rifle, and `Gallant` returns *Gallant Rifle Battery* - 170 attachment items carry 4,403
 * price rows, the biggest category by row count in the dataset. The fix is deliberately NOT a
 * category blacklist: magazines are real things players shop for, and a hardcoded demotion would
 * be wrong the moment someone actually wants one. Instead an EXACT or WHOLE-PREFIX match outranks
 * a token match, and ties break on the SHORTER name - which puts "P4-AR" above "P4-AR Magazine
 * (40 Cap)" by construction, for every weapon in the game and any that CIG adds later.
 *
 * ⚠️ 3. SHIP COMPONENTS ARE BARE ONE-WORD NAMES. The quantum drive is `name: "Burst"`, with
 * `ArcCorp` and size `1` in separate fields. A player types "ArcCorp Burst" or just "behring". So
 * the manufacturer is part of the haystack - but a company-only hit scores below a name hit, or
 * typing a manufacturer buries the item you named underneath its 137 stablemates.
 *
 * 🔑 THE INITIALS RULE IS BORROWED FROM THE MISSION LOOKUP, WHERE IT WAS MEASURED. That feature
 * found a plain subsequence match ("are the letters present in order") filled six of eight slots
 * with noise, while word INITIALS are what people actually type - `dsh` -> "Deep space hit". Same
 * rule here, same reason.
 */

/** Split a name into the words a person would say. Digits and letters part company on purpose:
 *  "P4-AR" becomes ["p4","ar"] so typing `P4` or `AR` both reach it, and "FR-76" becomes
 *  ["fr","76"]. Anything non-alphanumeric is a boundary, which is exactly what stops a match from

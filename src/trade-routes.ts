/**
 * TRADE - THE SIDECAR SURFACE, DELIBERATELY ALL IN ONE FILE.
 *
 * 🔴 `overlay-server.ts` IS BEING RESTRUCTURED BY ANOTHER FLIGHT AS THIS IS WRITTEN, so this
 * subsystem touches it in exactly ONE place: one import and one call. Every route, every piece of
 * state and every default lives here. Anything added to this feature later belongs in this file
 * too - the moment a second hook appears in the server, that promise is gone.
 *
 * Routes — read-only GETs, and exactly one write:
 *
 *   GET  /api/trade/status              where the prices came from and how old they are
 *   GET  /api/trade/names               commodity names that can be BOUGHT somewhere (autocomplete)
 *   GET  /api/trade/commodity?name=     one commodity: every terminal, as ranges
 *   GET  /api/trade/routes?...          buy-low/sell-high runs, ranked
 *   GET  /api/trade/journal             what you really bought and sold, with realised profit
 *   POST /api/trade/journal/forget?lot= 🔴 the one write — "that cargo is gone, stop listing it"
 *
 * 🔑 EVERY RESPONSE CARRIES `source` AND THE TABLE'S AGE, not just the ones about prices. Sub's
 * requirement was that the user knows when they are on the fallback, and a widget can only say so
 * on the screen the user is actually looking at.
 *
 * ⚠️ The GETs are unauthenticated like the rest of the widget API, which is LAN-reachable (OBS
 * browser sources on another PC). That is acceptable here because they spend no credential, write
 * nothing, and reveal nothing the player did not already publish - they read a public price table.
 * ⚠️ The journal is the exception to the "nothing private" half: it is the player's own trading
 * record. It stays a plain GET because it names no credential and no path on disk, which is the bar
 * `SENSITIVE_GET` sets - but if it ever grows a field of that kind, it belongs on that list.
 * 🔑 The one WRITE is covered by the gate this note used to ask for, and by a stronger one:
 * `overlay-server.ts` refuses every non-GET that is not from this machine AND every request
 * carrying a foreign `Origin`, before this file is called. See references/security.md.

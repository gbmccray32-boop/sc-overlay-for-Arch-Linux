/** 🔴 THE SIDECAR MUST NOT OUTLIVE THE SHELL THAT SPAWNED IT.
 *
 *  An orphan keeps :8778 and nothing can reap or respawn it, so the next app to launch finds
 *  nowhere to put its own service and gives up — reaching the user as "my background service
 *  didn't start". That shipped as the 0.1.45 failure and recurred during the 0.1.46 install.
 *
 *  The shell already calls `server.kill()` on `before-quit`, and since the dev spawn stopped
 *  going through `cmd.exe` that call reaches the right process. This watchdog covers the case
 *  that handler CANNOT: before-quit never runs when the shell is killed rather than quitting —
 *  a crash, Task Manager, or the elevated `taskkill /F` a stuck app gets. It is also why the
 *  fix does not rest on tsx's process-tree behaviour, which is emergent and could change.
 *
 *  🔑 IT KEYS ON THE SHELL PROCESS, NOT ON HAVING A WINDOW. The overlay is a tray app that
 *  deliberately prevents `window-all-closed`, so the shell outlives every hidden window and
 *  toggled-off overlay. Sub's streaming PC talks to this sidecar to sync his stream theme to
 *  the ship he is in; exiting because a window went away would drop that integration, which is
 *  worse than the orphan this exists to prevent. Dying too eagerly is the expensive mistake here.
 *
 *  ⚠️ NO PARENT PID MEANS NO WATCHDOG, deliberately. A sidecar started by hand
 *  (`npm run overlay`, a flight's own port, the widget suite's sandbox) has no shell to outlive
 *  and must never exit on its own.
 *
 *  ⚠️ EPERM MEANS ALIVE. `process.kill(pid, 0)` throws EPERM for a process that exists but which
 *  we may not signal — an elevated shell seen from a less-privileged sidecar. Treating that as
 *  "gone" would kill a healthy sidecar; the safe direction of error is to linger. */

//      happened ("I just did X, what did it log?"). ~600 lines is well under 200 KB.
//   2. Per-line truncation. A line is normally ~120 bytes, but the engine emits multi-KB dumps and
//      a burst of those is what would actually hurt.
//   3. 🔑 BATCHED FLUSHES, never a frame per line. The log is loudest exactly when the rest of the
//      sidecar is busiest, and a frame per line would put an SSE write plus a DOM append in front
//      of every parse. At LOGVIEW_FLUSH_MS this widget costs at most 4 frames a second whatever

// reported by Chromium itself, not by our JS — `twitchchat.html` already wraps every provider in
// Promise.allSettled, so nothing throws and chat renders perfectly, and Chromium still prints
// "Access to fetch at 'https://api.frankerfacez.com/…' has been blocked by CORS policy" on every
// load. There is no JS that removes that line while the page issues the request.
//
// Measured 2026-08-25, with FFZ's origin down behind Cloudflare (`/v1/set/global` answered 000,
// 522 and 503 on three consecutive tries, body `error code: 1200`, and www.frankerfacez.com and

// every user, because `twitchChannel` ships defaulted to subliminalstv.

       8 SCU containers, and a container cannot be split — so the board was recommending work the

         1. Resolve like the PLANNER does — picked, then what the log saw, then the app's own ship
            detector. The advisor being stricter than the planner about the same ship is a bug on
            its face.
         2. Distinguish "no ship named" from "ship named, not in ships.json". The first is a
            question to ask; the second is a gap in our data, and punishing the player for it by
            hiding every contract is worse than not checking fit at all. */

  // mrNote() in missions.html. Same dev+loopback gate as the replay below.
  // Diagnostic liveness ping from the capture loop (electron/capture.cjs), throttled client-side to
  // ~15s, for an intermittent mining-loop hang that isn't root-caused yet. sidecar.log carries no

// What a scanned signature MEANS — `npx tsx src/mining-debris.test.ts`.
//
// Sub, 2026-07-29 (superseding "2,000 and 4,000 and anything above"): debris comes in whole
// salvage panels, so a debris signature is a MULTIPLE of 2,000. "It isn't in the rock table" is no
// longer evidence of debris on its own — a number that is neither ore nor a whole number of panels
// is `unknown`, and the app says so out loud rather than guessing "Debris".
//
// 🔑 The asymmetry asserted throughout: a value that matches the rock table is honoured whatever
// else is true of it. Weakening that would silently cost real ore call-outs, which is much worse
// than a missed piece of debris. The two values where both readings are live (16,000 Savrilium ×5
// and 18,000 Bexalite ×5) are the interesting cases and are checked against the real dataset.

/**
 * Self-check for rotated-session sharing.  Run with:  npx tsx src/log-share.test.ts
 *
 * There are two opposite expensive failures here and the tests exist to hold BOTH at once:
 *   - "uploads the same thing every launch forever" — backups are immutable, so a verdict of
 *     sent / no signal / unreadable is FINAL and must be remembered.
 *   - "never uploads anything again, silently" — the failure found on 2026-08-16. Recording a
 *     rule-based rejection as done blacklisted it permanently, so a player who updated the app
 *     after an SC patch lost their whole backlog. A rejection is a verdict about the RULE, not the
 *     file, so it goes to a separate list that is recoverable.
 *
 * 🔴 THIS SUITE IS KEPT OFFLINE BY A STUBBED `fetch`, NOT BY MAKING EVERY FIXTURE INELIGIBLE.
 * It used to be the latter: every fixture carried the word "chat" so the scrub emptied it, which
 * kept the suite offline at the cost of never once exercising the upload path — and it made the
 * offline property depend on reasoning about each new fixture. It also became actively dangerous
 * the moment the retention rule changed, because two fixtures that were only ineligible by virtue
 * of their PATCH became eligible under a WINDOW and would have POSTed to production.
 * The stub is asserted to be installed before a single fixture is written. See selfTest below.

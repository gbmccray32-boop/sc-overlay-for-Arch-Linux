 *  🔴 THE UNIT IS THE POOL, NOT THE MISSION — changed 2026-08-15, and it was a real bug. This list
 *  used to iterate contracts, so a pool fed by many contracts filled the panel with itself: Sub saw
 *  four rows that were four TITLES of one pool (`819a9851…`, United Wayfarers Club refuelling),
 *  all reading 5/8, where he should have seen four different pools. The old dedupe keyed on
 *  title + progress and could not catch it, because the titles genuinely differ.
 *  Measured over 4.9.0-LIVE.12344265: **89 distinct pools** behind 755 pool-bearing contracts, and
 *  **65 of the 89 span more than one title** — so this is the normal case, not an edge case. That
 *  one refuelling pool has **79 contract variants across 5 titles**.
 *
 *  🔑 A pool has ONE identity and it is `poolUuid`. That is also the key the website's pool page is
 *  addressed by, so the widget can link straight out to it.
 *
 *  🔑 The cost/reward fields are measured and deliberately left UN-RENDERED (Sub, 2026-08-15: the
 *  per-hour figure belongs to the session tracker, "not with the closest to done"). They are kept
 *  because they are cheap and already computed; do not tidy them away, and do not render them
 *  without asking. Coverage over the 755 contracts: 748 carry a payout AND a run length, 726 a

   *  empty. That is the honest answer: with the receipts interleaved there is no evidence in
   *  the log saying which mission paid out, and the log never attributes a blueprint to a

   * different rank however wrong the linearity assumption turns out to be: the error is bounded
   * by one rank's width. Taking the floor instead is not the cautious choice — it is
   * *guaranteed* to be wrong by up to a full band, every time, always in the same direction. A
   * bounded estimate beats a certain understatement.
   *   · Pixel resolution is not the limit: the bar measures ~170px on a 3440-wide frame, so one
   *     pixel is 0.6% — about 14 rep across Battaglia's widest early band. Negligible beside the
   *     linearity question.
   *   · The top rank has no ceiling, so there is nothing to interpolate into and it takes the
   *     floor. Same when the bar could not be measured.
   * ⚠️ It is an ESTIMATE and the UI has to say so — see `estimated` in the result and
   * `repFloorFromRank` on the track. 🔲 It is verifiable and nobody has done it yet: run one
   * mission whose `reputationGained` we already know, scan before and after, and check the bar
   * moved by the predicted fraction. That is the measurement that would turn this from an
   * assumption into a fact, or replace it.
   *
   * The result is always taken — the scan wins outright, in both directions. That is the whole
   * feature: a stored total that says rank 4 when the page says rank 2 is wrong, and a total of
   * zero when the page says rank 2 is wrong the other way.
   *
   * ⚠️ `repAccruedMissionIds` is deliberately NOT cleared. It is the exactly-once guard for
   * completions, not a record of the total; clearing it would let every completion still in the
   * log re-credit itself on the next seed and walk the freshly-corrected number straight back up.

     * Associate, floor 6,000) beside a bar reading "Prospective Associate · 0 rep · 2,400 to

     * already holds. The reward ladder in the same widget had reconciled the two for months
     * (`currentRank()`); the bar never did.
     *
     * Taking the HIGHER floor is not a guess: both are lower bounds, so the larger is the better

  /**
   * 🔴 ONE MALFORMED FIELD USED TO DESTROY EVERY FIELD BELOW IT, SILENTLY AND PERMANENTLY.
   *
   * This whole method was one `try` whose catch was an empty block commented "first run", so
   * ANY throw part-way through abandoned the rest of the assignments — leaving them at their
   * constructor defaults — and the next `saveState()` then wrote those defaults to disk. The
   * data was not corrupted; it was *discarded on read* and then overwritten by a healthy-looking
   * save. Nothing logged, nothing failed.
   *
   * Measured (flight `orisonfix`, 2026-08-27): `missionHistory` is assigned 12th of 15 via
   * `dedupeHistory()`, which throws on a non-array or an array holding `null` (it does
   * `[...rows].sort()` and then reads `r.at`). One bad history therefore took `missionHistory`,
   * `eventContributions`, `rewardPrompts` AND `askedTiers` with it — four fields for one fault:
   *
   *     control: untouched good file                observed=2 hist=1 contrib=1 asked=1
   *     missionHistory is a bare object (not array) observed=2 hist=0 contrib=0 asked=0
   *     missionHistory holds a null entry           observed=2 hist=0 contrib=0 asked=0
   *
   * 🔑 TWO SEPARATE REPAIRS, and the second is the one that matters. Per-field isolation stops
   * the blast radius; **preserving what we could not read** stops the data loss. A field we
   * failed to parse is written back BYTE-FOR-BYTE by `saveState()` rather than replaced with an
   * empty default, so a later build that can read it still finds it there. Overwriting a field
   * you did not understand is how a read bug becomes a write bug.
   *
   * ⚠️ The distinction the old single `catch` could not make: an unreadable FILE really is a
   * first run (return, defaults are correct); an unreadable FIELD inside a readable file is
   * damage, and the safe response is to keep it, not to normalise it away.

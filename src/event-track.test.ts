/**
 * Dynamic-event tracking: event identification and contribution accumulation.
 *
 * 🔴 THE REGRESSION THIS EXISTS FOR. The shipped code identified an event mission with
 * `generator === "TheBackpocket"`. CIG uses that ONE generator for BOTH Return of XenoThreat
 * (5 `RoX_` contracts) and 4.10's Orison Relief (13 `ORS_`), so 10 of the 13 Orison Relief
 * contracts would have shown a player the XenoThreat reward ladder — wrong items, and a note
 * telling them to check "Journal → Return of XenoThreat" while running Siege of Orison.
 *
 * Run with:  npx tsx src/event-track.test.ts

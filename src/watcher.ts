/**
 * Tails a Star Citizen game.log and emits structured events.
 *
 * Robustness notes specific to this log:
 *  - SC truncates/overwrites game.log on every launch. We detect that as the
 *    file size shrinking below our read position, reset to 0, and emit "rotate".
 *  - The game keeps the file open and writes to it live; we open with a fresh
 *    read handle per poll (Node requests shared access), so we don't fight its
 *    lock and we never hold a handle to a stale, rotated-away file.
 *  - The file may not exist yet (game not launched). We wait and emit "appear"
 *    once it shows up.
 *
 * Events:
 *   "event"   (e: LogEvent)  a parsed line
 *   "line"    (raw: string)  the same line, unparsed
 *   "appear"  ()             the file came into existence
 *   "rotate"  ()             the file was truncated/replaced (new session)
 *   "error"   (err: Error)   a non-fatal read error; polling continues

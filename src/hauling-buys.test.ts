// 🔴 THE CLAIM THIS FILE EXISTS TO DEFEND: nothing here ever chooses a tonnage. A pick is stored
// with `scu: null` and the ONLY thing that fills it is a purchase line out of `game.log`. Sub's
// ruling — "they don't need to pick it. They can decide when they get there and when they buy it,
// we'll know how much they bought and then it'll override it."
//
// ⚠️ EVERY LOG LINE BELOW IS CAPTURED, not constructed. The one exception is stated where it is
// used and differs from its original in the timestamp alone. This matters: the block that once
// asserted the container formula was built on a CONSTRUCTED fixture carrying `boxSize[1]`, where a
// container count and an SCU count are the same number — so it could not tell right from wrong,
// and a real 10 SCU sale was read as 20 for weeks.

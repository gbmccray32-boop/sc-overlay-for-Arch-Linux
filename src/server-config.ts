/**
 * THE SIDECAR'S CONFIG — its shape, its defaults, where it lives on disk, and how it is read.
 *
 * 🔴 THE PATHS AND THE CONFIG ARE ONE SUBJECT, which is why they share a file. The whole reason
 * the path block exists is that config must be written to %APPDATA% and NEVER beside the binary:
 * the installed app lives under Program Files (read-only), and writing there threw EPERM and
 * killed the sidecar invisibly — which presented as a blank config window and no sync at all.
 * Separating "where it goes" from "what it is" would put that reasoning in a different file from
 * the thing it constrains.
 *
 * What is NOT here: the mutable `config` singleton itself. It stays in overlay-server.ts as
 * `let config: Config = loadConfig()`, so all 239 `config.` reads are untouched and nothing had
 * to learn an accessor. This module hands out the shape and the loader; the server owns the value.
 *
 * `payoutScanWasArmedOnDisk` is an exported `let` written only by `loadConfig`. ESM export
 * bindings are live, so the server reads the current value rather than a snapshot — that is the
 * only reason it can stay a flag instead of becoming a return value, which would have been a
 * signature change rather than a move.
 *
 * Lifted verbatim out of overlay-server.ts (2026-08-19).

  // off disk every tick (`readConfig`), so a field that is never written is a field it can never
  // see — `payout` was permanently false, the contract-region crop at capture.cjs:713 never ran,
  // and the dashboard sat on "no board on screen" forever while every server-side surface
  // correctly reported the mode as ON. Nothing failed loudly; `c8c2aca` introduced it as a
  // tightening and no board was swept afterwards to notice. Forcing it off on LOAD gives the
  // same guarantee — the mode cannot survive a launch — without lying to the process that has
  // to act on it.

// excluded: it is a bundled DEFAULT, not evidence that this user has configured anything, and
// it never ships (tools/build-server.mjs filters it out) so packaged behaviour is unchanged
// either way. Including it meant the wizard could never fire on a machine that happened to have
// a dev seed lying around — which is every developer's, and which made `npm run dev:fresh`
// (the only way to walk first-run setup once you have already done it) silently useless.

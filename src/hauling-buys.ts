/**
 * COMMODITY BUYS — the runs the player picked, waiting to be sequenced into the route.
 *
 * ── 🔴 THE ONE RULE, AND IT IS SUB'S ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * **Quantity is never chosen here, by the player or by us.** Sub, deciding how the merged Route
 * would work:
 *
 *   "There won't be any need to change how much SCU because the player can pick that. Actually,
 *    they don't need to pick it. They can decide when they get there and when they buy it, we'll
 *    know how much they bought and then it'll override it."
 *
 * So a buy enters the route with `scu: null` — UNKNOWN, never zero and never a guess — and the real
 * figure arrives from `game.log` when the purchase happens. `hauling-route.ts` routes an unknown
 * quantity as no load, which makes every load figure on that trip a FLOOR and says so through
 * `RoutePlan.unknownScu`. Nothing in this file, and nothing downstream of it, may pick a number.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE OPTIMISER THAT WAS DELIBERATELY NOT BUILT: one that chooses how much to buy to fill the
 * hold. It was considered and rejected. The log is the source of truth everywhere else in this app
 * and this is not the exception — a suggested tonnage would be indistinguishable on screen from a
 * measured one, which is the failure mode this codebase spends most of its comments avoiding.
 *
 * ── 🔴 AND THE SECOND RULE: CONTRACTS AND COMMODITIES ARE NEVER CO-RANKED ─────────────────────
 *
 *   "you'll do the contracts and then you'll pick up commodities as more of an opportunistic
 *    approach... it doesn't really matter that contracts is going to rank by however much per
 *    hour."
 *
 * Contracts rank among themselves in the Contracts tab; commodity runs rank among themselves in
 * the Commodities tab. Route SEQUENCES what came out of either — it does not weigh one against the
 * other, and there is deliberately no shared profit-per-hour currency anywhere in this file. The
 * prices carried on a record below are the quote the player was looking at when they picked it,
 * kept so the row can show what it was, and they are never fed to the solver.
 *
 * ── STATE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * 🔴 `STATE_VERSION` IS A DATA-DESTRUCTION SWITCH ON THIS FILE, NOT A SCHEMA LABEL. `read()`
 * returns empty on a mismatch, exactly like every other state reader in this app, so bumping it
 * because a field was added silently deletes the picks of everyone who already has some. An
 * additive change is a BACKFILL ON READ and the version must not move. Bump only for something
 * that genuinely cannot be read forward.
